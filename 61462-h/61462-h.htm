  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Committee on Standard Methods of Bacteriological Water Analysis was
reorganized in 1918 with the following membership: F. P. Gorham, chairman,
L. A. Rogers, W. G. Bissell, H. E. Hasseltine, H. W. Redfield, with M. Levine as
adjunct member. This committee made a report in 1918 which was not acted
on by the Laboratory Section, and in 1919 made a revised report, recommending
certain changes in Standard Methods, which were adopted by the section and
which are now incorporated in this present fourth edition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Following are the more important changes:</p>

<p class='c009'>New brands of peptone authorized.</p>

<p class='c009'>Phenol Red Method of Hydrogen-ion Concentration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Five-tenths per cent of sugar specified for broths instead of 1 per cent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sterilization of sugar is media specified in greater detail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Preparation of Endo Medium.</p>

<p class='c009'>Synthetic Medium for the Methyl Red Test.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are no changes in the chemical methods in this edition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Compiled and revised by committees of the American Public
Health Association and the American Chemical Society and
referees of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>COLLECTION OF SAMPLES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>QUANTITY REQUIRED FOR ANALYSIS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The minimum quantity necessary for making the ordinary physical,
chemical, and microscopical analyses of water or sewage is
2 liters; for the bacteriological examination, 100 cc. In special
analyses larger quantities may be required.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BOTTLES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The bottles for the collection of samples shall have glass stoppers,
except when physical, mineral, or microscopical examinations
only are to be made. Jugs or metal containers shall not be used.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sample bottles shall be carefully cleansed each time before using.
This may be done by treating with sulfuric acid and potassium
bichromate, or with alkaline permanganate, followed by a mixture
of oxalic and sulfuric acids, and by thoroughly rinsing with water
and draining. The stoppers and necks of the bottles shall be protected
from dirt by tying cloth, thick paper or tin foil over them.</p>

<p class='c009'>For shipment bottles shall be packed in cases with a separate
compartment for each bottle. Wooden boxes may be lined with
corrugated fibre paper, felt, or similar substance, or provided with
spring corner strips, to prevent breakage. Lined wicker baskets
also may be used.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Bottles for bacteriological samples shall be sterilized as directed
on page <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>INTERVAL BEFORE ANALYSIS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In general, the shorter the time elapsing between the collection
and the analysis of a sample the more reliable will be the analytical
results. Under many conditions analyses made in the field are
to be commended, as data so obtained are frequently preferable
to data obtained in a distant laboratory after the composition
of the water has changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time that may be allowed to elapse between the collection of
a sample and the beginning of its analysis cannot be stated definitely.
It depends on the character of the sample, the examinations
to be made, and other conditions. The following are suggested as
fairly reasonable maximum limits.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a longer period elapses between collection and examination
the time should be noted. If sterilized by the addition of chloroform,
formaldehyde, mercuric chloride, or some other germicide
samples for sanitary chemical examination may be allowed to
stand for longer periods than those indicated, but as this is a
matter which will vary according to circumstances, no definite
procedure is recommended. If unsterilized samples of sewage,
sewage effluents, and highly polluted surface waters are analyzed
after greater intervals than those suggested caution must be used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>in interpreting analyses of the organic content, which frequently
changes materially upon standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Determinations of dissolved gases, especially oxygen, hydrogen
sulfide, and carbon dioxide, should be made at the time of collection
in order to be reasonably accurate, in accordance with the directions
given hereafter in connection with each determination.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Care should be taken to obtain a sample that is truly representative
of the liquid to be analyzed. With sewages this is especially
important because marked variations in composition occur from
hour to hour. Satisfactory samples of some liquids can be obtained
only by mixing together several portions collected at different times
or at different places—the details as to collection and mixing
depending upon local conditions.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>TEMPERATURE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The temperature of the sample, if taken, shall be taken at the time
of collection, and shall be expressed preferably in degrees Centigrade,
to the nearest degree, or closer if more precise data are required.
The thermophone<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a> is recommended for obtaining the temperature
of water at various depths below the surface.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TURBIDITY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The turbidity of water is due to suspended matter, such as clay,
silt, finely divided organic matter, microscopic organisms, and
similar material.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TURBIDITY STANDARD.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c015'><sup>[110]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c011'>The standard of turbidity shall be that adopted by the United
States Geological Survey, namely, a water which contains 100 parts
per million of silica in such a state of fineness that a bright platinum
wire 1 millimeter in diameter can just be seen when the center
of the wire is 100 millimeters below the surface of the water and the
eye of the observer is 1.2 meters above the wire, the observation
being made in the middle of the day, in the open air, but not in
sunlight, and in a vessel so large that the sides do not shut out the
light so as to influence the results. The turbidity of such water is
arbitrarily fixed at 100 parts per million.</p>

<p class='c009'>For preparation of the silica standard dry Pear’s “precipitated
fuller’s earth” and sift it through a 200–mesh sieve. One gram of this
preparation in 1 liter of distilled water makes a stock suspension
which contains 1,000 parts per million of silica and which should
have a turbidity of 1,000. Test this suspension, after diluting
a portion of it with nine times its volume of distilled water, by the
platinum wire method to ascertain if the silica has the necessary
degree of fineness and if the suspension has the necessary degree
of turbidity. If not, correct by adding more silica or more water as
the case demands.<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c015'><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='fA'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#rA'>A</a>. This method of correction very slightly alters the coefficient of fineness of the standard, but
does not noticeably affect its use.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Standards for comparison shall be prepared from this stock suspension
by dilution with distilled water. For turbidity readings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>below 20, standards of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 shall be kept in clear glass
bottles of the same size as that containing the sample; for readings
above 20, standards of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 shall be
kept in 100 cc. Nessler tubes approximately 20 millimeters in
diameter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Comparison with the standards shall be made by viewing both
standard and sample sidewise toward the light by looking at some
object and noting the distinctness with which the margins of the
object can be seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The standards shall be kept stoppered, and both sample and
standards shall be thoroughly shaken before making the comparison.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to prevent any bacterial or algal growths from developing
in the standards a small amount of mercury bichloride may be
added to them.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PLATINUM WIRE METHOD.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c011'>This method requires a rod with a platinum wire 1 mm. in
diameter inserted in it about 1 inch from one end of the rod and
projecting from it at a right angle at least 25 mm. Near the other
end of the rod, at a distance of 1.2 meters from the platinum wire,
a small ring shall be placed directly above the wire through which,
with his eye directly above the ring, the observer shall look when
making the examination.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rod shall be graduated as follows: The graduation mark of
100 shall be placed on the rod at a distance of 100 mm. from the
center of the wire. Other graduations shall be made according to
Table 1, which is based on the best obtainable data. The distances
recorded in Table 1 are intended to be such that when the water
is diluted the turbidity readings will decrease in the same proportion
as the percentage of the original water in the mixture. These
graduations are those on what is known as the U. S. Geological
Survey Turbidity Rod of 1902.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Lower the rod vertically into the water as far as the
wire can be seen and read the level of the surface of the water
on the graduated scale. This will indicate the turbidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following precautions shall be taken to insure correct results:</p>

<p class='c009'>Observations shall be made in the open air, preferably in the
middle of the day and not in direct sunlight. The wire shall be
kept bright and clean. If for any reason observations cannot be
made directly under natural conditions a pail or tank may be filled
with water and the observation taken in that, but if this is done care
shall be taken that the water is thoroughly stirred before the observation
is made, and no vessel shall be used for this purpose unless
its diameter is at least twice as great as the depth to which the wire
is immersed. Waters which have a turbidity greater than 500
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>shall be diluted with clear water before the observations are made,
but if this is done the degree of dilution shall be reported.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TURBIDIMETRIC METHOD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Several forms of turbidimeter or diaphanometer<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a> have been
suggested for use. The simplest and most satisfactory form is
the candle turbidimeter.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c015'><sup>[116]</sup></a> This consists of a graduated glass tube
with a flat polished bottom, enclosed in a metal case. This is
supported over an English standard candle and so arranged that
one may look vertically down through the tube at the flame of the
candle. The observation is made by pouring the sample of water
into the tube until the image of the flame of the candle just disappears
from view. Care shall be taken not to allow soot or moisture
to accumulate on the lower side of the glass bottom of the tube
so as to interfere with the accuracy of the observations. The
graduations on the tube correspond to turbidities produced in
distilled water by certain numbers of parts per million of silica
standard. In order to insure uniform results it is necessary to
have the distance between the top rim of the candle and the bottom
of the tube constant, and this distance shall be 7.6 cm. or 3
inches. The observations shall be made in a darkened room or with
a black cloth over the head.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is allowable to substitute for the candle an electric light.
Calibrate the apparatus to correspond with the United States
Geological Survey scale. The figures in Table 2 on page <a href='#Page_8'>8</a> are
believed to be approximately correct for the candle turbidimeter
but should be checked by the experimenter. It is allowable to
calibrate the tube of the instrument with waters of known turbidity
prepared by making a series of dilutions of the silica standard with
distilled water. From the figures obtained in calibrating plot a
curve from which the turbidity of a sample may be read when
the depth of water in the tube has been obtained.</p>

(PtCl<sub>4</sub>2KCl), containing 0.5 gram platinum, and 1.00 gram crystallized
cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O), containing 0.25 gram of cobalt,
in water with 100 cc. concentrated hydrochloric acid, and dilute to
1 liter with distilled water. This solution has a color of 500.
Dilute this solution with distilled water in 50 cc. Nessler tubes to
prepare standards having colors of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,
50, 60, and 70. Keep these standards in Nessler tubes of such

the bottom and of such uniformity that they match within such limit
that the distance from the bottom to the graduation mark of the

<p class='c011'>The observation of the odor, cold and hot, of samples of surface
water is important as the odors are usually indicative of organic
growths or sewage contamination or both. The odor of some
ground waters is caused by the earthy constituents of the water-bearing
strata. The odor of a contaminated well water is often
contributory evidence of its pollution. A study of the organisms
as directed under Microscopical Examination (p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>) is a valuable
adjunct to physical and chemical examination of water. Certain
odors distinguish or identify certain organisms, as, for example, the
“fishy” odor of <em>Uroglena</em>, the “aromatic” or “rose geranium” odor
of <em>Asterionella</em> and the “pig pen” odor of <em>Anabaena</em>. Observe and
record the odor, both at room temperature and at just below the
boiling point, as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COLD ODOR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Shake the sample violently in one of the collecting bottles, when
it is half to two-thirds full and when the sample is at room temperature
(about 20° C.). Remove the stopper and smell the odor at
the mouth of the bottle.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>HOT ODOR.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Pour about 150 cc. of the sample into a 500 cc. Erlenmeyer flask.
Cover the flask with a well-fitting watch glass. Heat the water
almost to boiling on a hot plate. Remove the flask from the plate
and allow it to cool not more than five minutes. Then agitate
it with a rotary movement, slip the watch glass to one side, and
smell the odor.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>FORMS OF NITROGEN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Nitrogenous organic matter passes through several intermediate
compounds during its natural decomposition, and that which does
not gasify ultimately forms nitrate. Nitrogen in organic matter
is determined by the Kjeldahl process.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a><a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a> An indication of the

It has not been found possible to differentiate
the nitrogen in the organic matter that readily decomposes from
that in stable or non-putrescible compounds. Decomposition of
organic matter produces nitrogen combined in ammonia, which is
the first step between nitrogenous organic matter and the completely
mineralized nitrate. Ammonia nitrogen may be determined
by distillation and Nesslerization or by direct Nesslerization of the
clarified sample. The next step is oxidation to nitrite, and the
final step, oxidation to nitrate. It is recommended that all forms of
nitrogen be reported as the element nitrogen (N).</p>

<h3 class='c010'>AMMONIA NITROGEN.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There are two methods for estimating ammonia nitrogen—distillation
and direct Nesslerization. Distillation is recommended for
most waters and direct Nesslerization is recommended for sewages,
sewage effluents, and highly polluted surface waters.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DETERMINATION BY DISTILLATION.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a><a id='r68b' /><a href='#f68b' class='c015'><sup>[68b]</sup></a><a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a><a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c011'><em>Procedure.</em>—Use a metal or a glass flask connected with a condenser
so that the distillate may drop from the condenser tube
directly into a Nessler tube or a flask. Free the apparatus from
ammonia by boiling distilled water in it until the distillate shows
no trace of ammonia. After this has been done empty the distilling
flask and measure into it 500 cc. of the sample, or a smaller portion
diluted to 500 cc. with ammonia-free water. If the sample is acid
or if the presence of urea is suspected add about 0.5 gram of sodium
carbonate before distillation. Omit this if possible as it tends to
increase “bumping.” Apply heat so that the distillation may
proceed at the rate of not more than 10 cc. nor less than 6 cc. per
minute. Collect the distillate in four Nessler tubes, 50 cc. to each
tube, or if the nitrogen is high in a 200 cc. graduated flask. These

<h5 class='c016'>MEASUREMENT OF AMMONIA NITROGEN.</h5>

<p class='c011'>The amount of ammonia in the distillates may be measured
either by (1) comparison of the Nesslerized distillates with Nesslerized
solutions containing known quantities of nitrogen as ammonium
chloride, or by (2) comparison of the Nesslerized distillates with
permanent standard solutions in which the colors of Nesslerized
standard ammonia solutions are duplicated by solutions of platinum
and cobalt chlorides.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Comparison with ammonia standards.</span></h6>

<p class='c011'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Ammonia-free water.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Standard ammonium chloride solution. Dissolve 3.82 grams of
ammonium chloride in ammonia-free water and dilute to 1 liter;
dilute 10 cc. of this to 1 liter with ammonia-free water. One cc.
equals 0.00001 gram of nitrogen.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Nessler reagent.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Dissolve 50 grams of potassium iodide in
a minimum quantity of cold water. Add a saturated solution of
mercuric chloride until a slight precipitate persists permanently.
Add 400 cc. of 50 per cent solution of potassium hydroxide, made
by dissolving the potassium hydroxide and allowing it to clarify by
sedimentation before using. Dilute to 1 liter, allow to settle,
and decant. This solution should give the required color with
ammonia within five minutes after addition and should not produce
a precipitate with small amounts of ammonia within two hours.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Prepare a series of 16 Nessler tubes containing the
following amounts of the standard ammonium chloride solution,
diluted to 50 cc. with ammonia-free water, namely: 0.0, 0.1, 0.3,
0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 6.0 cc.
These solutions will contain 0.00001 gram of nitrogen for each cubic
centimeter of the standard solution.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nesslerize the standards and the distillates by adding approximately
1 cc. of Nessler reagent to each tube. Do not stir the
contents of the tubes. The temperature of the tubes should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>practically the same as that of the standards; otherwise the colors
will not be directly comparable.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Allow the tubes to stand at least
10 minutes after Nesslerizing. Compare the color produced in the
tubes with that in the standards by looking vertically downward
through them at a white or mirrored surface placed at an angle in
front of a window so as to reflect the light upward.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the color obtained by Nesslerizing the distillates is greater than
that of the darkest tube of the standards, mix the contents of the
tube thoroughly, pour out half of the liquid, and dilute the remainder
to the original volume with ammonia-free water; then make the
color comparison and multiply the result by two. If the color is
still too dark after pouring out half the liquid, repeat this process
of division until a reading can be made. The process of dilution
may be shortened by mixing together the distillates from one sample
before making the comparison and comparing an aliquot portion
with the standards.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the readings have been recorded add the results obtained
by Nesslerizing each portion of the entire distillate. If 500 cc.
of the sample is distilled this sum, expressed in cubic centimeters
and multiplied by 0.02, will give the number of parts per million
of ammonia nitrogen in the sample. If x cc. of sample is used
multiply the sum of the readings by 10/x.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the ammonia is known to be high the distillate may be collected
in 200 cc. flasks and an aliquot part Nesslerized.</p>

<p class='c009'>The amounts in Table 5 are approximate, and the actual amount
necessary will differ with the character of the Nessler solution, the
color sensitiveness of the analyst’s eye, and other conditions. The
final test of the standard is best obtained by comparing it with
Nesslerized standards and modifying the tint accordingly. Such
comparison should be made for each new batch of Nessler solution
and should be checked by each analyst.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—In comparison with permanent standards, Nesslerize
the distillates in the manner above described and compare the
resulting colors at the end of about 10 minutes with the permanent
standards. The method of calculating results is precisely the same
as with the ammonia standards.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>MODIFICATION FOR SEWAGE.</h5>

<p class='c011'>Ammonia nitrogen and albuminoid nitrogen in sewages, soils, and
other materials of high nitrogen content may be satisfactorily determined
by diluting the sample with ammonia-free distilled water and
proceeding as described in the preceding sections, but it is permissible
to distill with steam.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><em>Procedure.</em>—Use a 200 cc. long-necked Kjeldahl flask connected
with a condenser so that the distillate may drop from the condenser
tube directly into a Nessler tube or a flask. Connect the Kjeldahl
flask with a steam generator by a tube reaching almost to the
bottom of the flask.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the apparatus is freed from ammonia put the sample to be
tested into the flask. Use 10 to 100 cc. of the sample according to
its ammonia content. Pass ammonia-free steam through the liquid
in the Kjeldahl flask and collect the distillate in the usual way. It
is usually convenient to collect the distillate in a 200 cc. flask and
to take an aliquot part of it for Nesslerization. Compare with
standards and calculate the nitrogen content in the usual manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>This method has the advantage, when the sample is treated with
an alkaline solution of potassium permanganate, of avoiding bumping,
permitting the assay of solid matter, and yielding the ammonia
more rapidly than by the ordinary process of distillation.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>ALBUMINOID NITROGEN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The addition of an alkaline permanganate solution to liquids containing
nitrogenous organic matter causes the formation of ammonia,
which can be distilled and determined by Nesslerization of the
distillate. The nitrogen of the ammonia, thus obtained, is called
albuminoid nitrogen. As the ratio of nitrogenous organic matter to
the ammonia obtained by distillation is decidedly variable<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a> in
sewages and other substances containing much nitrogenous organic
matter albuminoid nitrogen results on such substances are less
accurate<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> than organic (Kjeldahl) nitrogen. Therefore in sewage
work, including analysis of influents and effluents of purification
plants and the water of highly polluted streams, it is recommended
that determinations of organic nitrogen be substituted for determinations
of albuminoid nitrogen. For ground waters and surface
waters containing but little pollution, the albuminoid nitrogen is
approximately one-half the organic nitrogen; accordingly the continuance
of albuminoid nitrogen determinations for this class of
work is approved.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Reagents.</em>—Alkaline potassium permanganate. Pour 1,200 cc. of
distilled water into a porcelain dish holding 2,500 cc., boil 10
minutes, and turn off the gas. Add 16 grams of C. P. potassium
permanganate and stir until solution is complete. Then add 800
cc. of 50 per cent clarified solution of potassium hydroxide or an
equivalent amount of sodium hydroxide and enough distilled water
to fill the dish. Boil down to 2,000 cc. Test this solution for
ammonia by making a blank determination. Correct determinations
by the amount of this blank.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—After the collection of the distillate for ammonia
nitrogen described on page <a href='#Page_15'>15</a> add 50 cc. (or more if necessary to
insure the complete oxidation of the organic matter) of alkaline
potassium permanganate and continue the distillation until at least
four portions, and preferably five portions, of 50 cc. each, of distillate
have been collected in separate tubes. Determine the
albuminoid nitrogen in the distillate by Nesslerization. If the albuminoid
nitrogen is known to be high it is convenient to collect the
distillate in a 200 cc. flask and to Nesslerize an aliquot part of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dissolved albuminoid nitrogen may be determined in a sample
from which suspended matter has been removed by filtration either
through filter paper or through a Berkefeld filter. Suspended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>albuminoid nitrogen is the difference between the total and the

<p class='c011'><em>Procedure for water.</em>—Boil 500 cc. of the sample in a round-bottomed
flask to remove ammonia nitrogen. This usually causes
the loss of 200 cc. of the sample, which may be collected for the
determination of ammonia nitrogen. Add 5 cc. of nitrogen-free
concentrated sulfuric acid and a small piece of ignited pumice.
Mix by shaking and place over a flame under a hood. Digest until
copious fumes of sulfuric acid are given off and the liquid finally
becomes colorless or pale straw color. Remove from the flame,
and add potassium permanganate crystals in small portions until a
heavy green precipitate persists in the liquid. Cool. Dilute to
about 300 cc. with ammonia-free water. Make alkaline with
10 per cent ammonia-free sodium hydroxide. Distill the ammonia,
collect the distillate in Nessler tubes, Nesslerize, and compare with
standards as described (pp. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>–18).</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First procedure for sewage</em><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a>.—Distill the ammonia nitrogen
directly from 100 cc. or less of the sample, diluted to 500 cc. with

and 1 cc. of 10 per cent nitrogen-free copper sulfate, and digest
the liquid for half an hour after it has become colorless or pale
straw color. Add 0.5 gram of potassium permanganate crystals
to the hot acid solution, and dilute to 500 cc. with ammonia-free
water. Dilute 10 cc. or more of this liquid, in a Kjeldahl distilling
flask, to about 300 cc. with ammonia-free water. Make alkaline
with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide, distill, and Nesslerize. With
some samples direct Nesslerization may be used. (See p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In this determination care must be taken to digest thoroughly,
to add potassium permanganate to the point of precipitation, to
sample carefully after dilution, and to add enough sodium hydroxide
to insure the separation of the ammonia from the precipitated

added during digestion because it causes loss of nitrogen.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second procedure for sewage.</em>—Omit the separation of ammonia

<p class='c009'>5. Fuchsine solution. 0.1 gram per liter.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Place in a standard Nessler tube 50 cc. of the

suggested: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, and 2.5 cc. Add
1 cc. of the sulfanilic acid solution and 1 cc. of the α-naphthylamine
acetate or hydrochloride solution to the sample and to
each standard. Mix thoroughly and allow to stand 10 minutes;
then compare the sample with the standards. Do not allow the

If the color of the sample is deeper than that of the

per million of chloride. Heat the mixture to boiling, add a little
aluminium hydroxide, stir, filter, and wash with small amounts
of hot water. Evaporate the filtrate to dryness, and add 2 cc. of the
phenoldisulfonic acid, rubbing with a glass rod to insure intimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>contact. If the residue becomes packed or appears vitreous
because of the presence of much iron, heat the dish on the water
bath for a few minutes. Dilute the mixture with distilled water,
and add slowly a strong solution of potassium hydroxide or ammonium
hydroxide until the maximum color is developed. Transfer
the solution to a Nessler tube, filtering if necessary. If nitrate
is present a yellow color will be formed. Compare the color with
that of standards<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a><a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> made by adding 2 cc. of strong potassium
hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide to various amounts of standard
nitrate solution and diluting them to 50 cc. in Nessler tubes.
The following amounts of standard nitrate solution are suggested:
0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, and 40.0 cc. These
standards may be kept several weeks without deterioration. If 100
cc. of water is used the number of cubic centimeters of the standard
multiplied by 0.01 is equal to parts per million of nitrate nitrogen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Standards that will remain permanent for several years if stored in
the dark may be prepared from tripotassium nitrophenoldisulfonate.<a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>If nitrite nitrogen is present in excess of 1 part per million it
should be oxidized by heating the samples a few minutes with a
few drops of hydrogen peroxide free from nitrate repeatedly added<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
or by adding dilute potassium permanganate in the cold until a faint

oxidized to nitrate is then subtracted from the final nitrate nitrogen
reading.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Sodium or potassium hydroxide solution. Dissolve
250 grams of the hydroxide in 1.25 liters of distilled water.
Add several strips of aluminium foil and allow the evolution of
hydrogen to continue over night. Concentrate the solution to 1 liter
by boiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Aluminium foil. Use strips of pure aluminium about 10 cm.
long, 6 mm. wide, and 0.33 mm. thick and weighing about 0.5 gram.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—To 100 cc. of the sample in a 300 cc. casserole add
2 cc. of the hydroxide solution and concentrate by boiling to about
20 cc. Pour the contents of the casserole into a test tube about
16 cm. long and 3 cm. in diameter, or of approximately 100 cc.
capacity. Rinse the casserole several times with nitrogen-free
water and add the rinse water to the liquid already in the tube,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>thus making the contents of the tube approximately 75 cc. Add a
strip of aluminium foil. Close the tube by means of a rubber
stopper through which passes a bent glass tube about 5 mm. in
diameter. Put the shorter arm of the tube flush with the lower
side of the rubber stopper and let the longer arm extend below
the surface of distilled water in another test tube. This apparatus
serves as a trap through which the evolved hydrogen escapes freely.
The small amount of ammonia escaping into the trap may be
neglected. Allow the action to proceed for a minimum period of
four hours or over night. Pour the contents of the tube into a
distilling flask, dilute with 250 cc. of ammonia-free water, distill,
collect the distillate in Nessler tubes, and Nesslerize. If the nitrate
content is high collect the distillate in a 200 cc. flask and Nesslerize
an aliquot part. If the supernatant liquid in the reduction tube is
clear and colorless the solution may be diluted to a definite volume
and an aliquot part Nesslerized without distillation.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TOTAL NITROGEN.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c011'>In sewage work it is frequently of assistance to know the total
nitrogen content. This is ordinarily computed by adding together
the organic, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate nitrogen, each of which
is determined as already described.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>OXYGEN CONSUMED.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a><a id='r84a' /><a href='#f84a' class='c015'><sup>[84a]</sup></a><a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a><a id='r94f' /><a href='#f94f' class='c015'><sup>[94f]</sup></a><a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a><a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c011'>Oxygen consumed means the oxygen that the oxidizable compounds
of sewage and water consume when treated in an acid
solution with potassium permanganate. The expression is synonymous
with oxygen required, oxygen absorbed, and oxygen-consuming
capacity. It should not be confused with biochemical oxygen
demand.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the carbon, not the nitrogen, in organic matter is oxidized
by potassium permanganate, oxygen consumed is considered by
some an indication of the amount of carbonaceous organic matter
present. The determination indicates, however, only part of
the carbon, the proportion varying in different samples because
the carbon in nitrogenous matter is not so readily oxidized as that
in carbonaceous organic matter. Furthermore, it does not directly
differentiate the carbon present in unstable organic matter from
that in fairly stable organic matter, such as is sometimes referred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to as residual humus matter. As nitrite nitrogen, ferrous iron,
sulfide, and other oxidizable mineral substances reduce potassium
permanganate, corrections for them should be made in the determination.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RECOMMENDED METHOD.</h4>

<p class='c011'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of concentrated
sulfuric acid with 3 parts of distilled water and free the
solution from oxidizable matter by adding potassium permanganate
until a faint pink color persists after the solution has stood several
hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Standard ammonium oxalate. Dissolve 0.888 gram of the pure
salt in 1 liter of distilled water. One cc. is equivalent to 0.1 mg.
of oxygen. An equivalent quantity of oxalic acid or sodium
oxalate may be used.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Standard potassium permanganate. Dissolve 0.4 gram of
the crystallized salt in 1 liter of distilled water. Add 10 cc. of the
dilute sulfuric acid and 10 cc. of this solution of potassium permanganate
to 100 cc. of distilled water, and digest 30 minutes. Add
10 cc. of the ammonium oxalate solution, and then add potassium
permanganate till a pink coloration appears. This destroys the
oxygen-consuming capacity of the water used. Now add another
10 cc. of ammonium oxalate solution and titrate with potassium
permanganate. Adjust the potassium permanganate solution so
that 1 cc. is equivalent to 1 cc. of ammonium oxalate solution or
0.1 mg. of available oxygen.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Acid digestion.</em>—Place in a flask 100 cc. of the water, or, if the
water is of high organic content, a smaller portion diluted to 100 cc.
Add 10 cc. of sulfuric acid solution and 10 cc. of standard potassium
permanganate and digest the liquid exactly 30 minutes in a bath
of boiling water the level of which is kept above the level of the
contents of the flask.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a><a id='r71a' /><a href='#f71a' class='c015'><sup>[71a]</sup></a> If the quantity of permanganate is insufficient
for complete oxidation repeat the digestion with a larger
quantity; at least 5 cc. excess of the standard permanganate should
be present when the ammonium oxalate solution is added. Remove
the flask, add 10 cc. of the ammonium oxalate solution, and
titrate with the standard permanganate until a faint but distinct
color is obtained. If 100 cc. of water is used the number of cubic
centimeters of potassium permanganate solution in excess of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>number of cubic centimeters of ammonium oxalate solution is
equal to parts per million of oxygen consumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>If oxidizable mineral substances, such as ferrous iron, sulfide,
or nitrite, are present in the sample corrections should be applied
as accurately as possible by suitable procedures. Direct titration
of the acidified sample in the cold, using a three-minute period
of digestion, serves this purpose quite well for polluted surface
waters and fairly well for purified sewage effluents. Few raw
sewages containing no trade wastes need such a correction, but
raw sewages containing “pickling” liquors do need it. If the sample
contains both oxidizable mineral compounds and gaseous
organic substances the latter should be driven off by heat and the
sample allowed to cool before applying this test for the correction
factor. If such corrections are made the fact should be stated
with the amount of correction.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Period and temperature of digestion.</em>—As the practice in regard
to the period and temperature of digestion has varied widely it is
difficult to compare the results obtained at one laboratory with
those obtained at another. None of the methods gives absolute
results. They are all relative<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a><a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a> at best. Digesting 30 minutes
at the boiling temperature is herein designated the recommended
method. If samples are analyzed by any other method the method
should be noted, and, representative results by the standard
method should be placed on record for purposes of comparison.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>OTHER METHODS.</h4>

<p class='c011'><em>Additional reagents.</em>—1. Potassium iodide solution. Ten per cent
solution, free from iodate.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Standard sodium thiosulfate. Dissolve 1.0 gram of the pure
crystallized salt in 1 liter of distilled water. Standardize this
solution against the standard potassium permanganate. As the
thiosulfate solution does not keep well determine its actual
strength at frequent intervals.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Starch indicator. Prepare as directed in the section on
dissolved oxygen (pp. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>–66).</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Sodium hydroxide solution. Dissolve 1 part of pure sodium
hydroxide in 2 parts of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Certain widely practiced deviations from the standard procedure
just described are noted in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Heat the acidified sample to boiling, add the permanganate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>solution, and digest for two minutes<a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> at boiling temperature.
This procedure is facilitated by agitating the liquid constantly
with a small current of air to guard against bumping.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Same method as No. 1 except that the period of digestion is
five minutes.<a id='r121a' /><a href='#f121a' class='c015'><sup>[121a]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>3. Same method as No. 2 except that the permanganate solution
is added to the acidified sample when cold, and digestion is
continued five minutes after the sample reaches the boiling point.
The advantage of this method is that there is included the oxygen-consuming
power of the volatile matter present in some sewages
and sewage effluents, which is driven off by heat and thus escapes
when the test is made in accordance with procedures 1 and 2.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Same method as No. 3 except that the period of digestion is
10 minutes.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a><a id='r68c' /><a href='#f68c' class='c015'><sup>[68c]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>5. Digestion of the sample after the acid and permanganate solutions
are added is carried out abroad, especially in England, at approximately
the room temperature,<a id='r24a' /><a href='#f24a' class='c015'><sup>[24a]</sup></a><a id='r69a' /><a href='#f69a' class='c015'><sup>[69a]</sup></a><a href='#f94f' class='c015'><sup>[94f]</sup></a><a id='r100a' /><a href='#f100a' class='c015'><sup>[100a]</sup></a> apparently to guard
against decomposition<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> of permanganate in the presence of high
chloride, for periods of three minutes, fifteen minutes, and four
hours; many observers record the oxygen consumed after all
three periods, while some record the result only for the four-hour
period. At the end of the period of digestion, add 0.5 cc.
of potassium iodide solution to discharge the pink color; mix;
titrate the liberated iodine with thiosulfate until the yellow
color is nearly destroyed, then add a few drops of starch solution
and continue titration until the blue color is just discharged.
The number of cubic centimeters of potassium permanganate solution
in excess of the number of cubic centimeters of sodium thiosulfate
solution is equal to parts per million of oxygen consumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Digestion in alkaline solution<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a> is preferable to digestion in
acid solution for brines or waters high in chlorine. Place in a
flask 100 cc. of the sample, or if it is of high organic content a
smaller portion diluted to 100 cc. Add 0.5 cc. of sodium hydroxide
solution and 10 cc. of standard potassium permanganate and
digest exactly 30 minutes. Remove the flask, add 5 cc. of sulfuric
acid and 10 cc. of the standard ammonium oxalate, and titrate with
the standard potassium permanganate as in the acid digestion.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Ignite the residue in the platinum dish at a low red

<h3 class='c010'>HARDNESS.<a id='r94e' /><a href='#f94e' class='c015'><sup>[94e]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c011'>A water containing certain mineral constituents in solution,
chiefly calcium and magnesium, which form insoluble compounds
with soap, is said to be hard. Carbon dioxide in water increases
the solubility of calcium and magnesium carbonates, forming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>bicarbonate. If carbon dioxide is removed from the water by
boiling the bicarbonate is decomposed and calcium and magnesium
are partly precipitated. The proportion of calcium or magnesium
carbonate that a water can hold in solution depends on the concentration
of carbon dioxide, which in turn depends on the temperature
of the water and the proportion of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere with which the water has been in contact. Consequently,
when the carbon dioxide is removed from the water by
boiling or otherwise the carbonates of calcium and magnesium are
partly, but not completely, precipitated, and the hardness of the
water is thus diminished and the water is softened to the extent to
which these substances are precipitated. The hardness thus removed
is called temporary hardness. The hardness which still remains
after boiling is due mainly to calcium and magnesium in
equilibrium with sulfate, chloride, and nitrate, and residual carbonate,
and it is called permanent hardness. Non-carbonate hardness
is the hardness caused by sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates of
calcium, magnesium, iron, and other metals that form insoluble
soaps.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOTAL HARDNESS BY CALCULATION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The most accurate method of ascertaining total hardness is to
compute it from the results of determinations of calcium and
magnesium in the sample. (See methods, pp. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>–58.) Iron and
other metals must be included in the calculation if they are present
in significant amounts. Total hardness as CaCO<sub>3</sub> equals 2.5 Ca
plus 4.1 Mg.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOTAL HARDNESS BY SOAP METHOD.<a id='r121b' /><a href='#f121b' class='c015'><sup>[121b]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c011'>The determination of hardness by the soap method roughly
approximates the amount of calcium and magnesium in a water,
though it actually measures the soap-consuming power of the water.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Standard calcium chloride solution. Dissolve 0.2
gram of pure calcite (calcium carbonate) in a little dilute hydrochloric
acid, being careful to avoid loss of solution by spattering.
Evaporate the solution to dryness several times with distilled
water to expel excess of acid. Dissolve the residue in distilled
water and dilute the solution to 1 liter. One cc. of this dilution is
equivalent to 0.2 mg. of calcium carbonate.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Standard soap solution. Dissolve 100 grams of dry white
Castile soap in 1 liter of 80 per cent alcohol, and allow this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>solution to stand several days before standardizing. Pure potassium
oleate made from lead plaster and potassium carbonate may
be used in place of Castile soap.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First method of standardization.</em>—Dilute 20 cc. of the calcium
chloride solution in a 250 cc. glass-stoppered bottle to 50 cc. with
distilled water which has been recently boiled and cooled. Add
soap solution from a burette, 0.2 or 0.3 cc. at a time, shaking the
bottle vigorously after each addition until a lather remains unbroken
for five minutes over the entire surface of the water while the
bottle lies on its side. Then adjust the strength of the stock solution
with 70 per cent alcohol so that the resulting diluted soap solution
will give a permanent lather when 6.40 cc. of it is properly added to
20 cc. of standard calcium chloride solution diluted to 50 cc. Usually
75 to 100 cc. of the stock soap solution is required to make 1 liter
of the standard soap solution. The quantity of calcium carbonate
equivalent to each cubic centimeter of the standard soap solution
consumed in the titration is indicated in Table 6.</p>

<p class='c009'>This table does not provide for the use of so large volume of
soap solution for a single determination as former ones because the
end-point becomes somewhat obscured in the presence of magnesium
if more than 7 cc. is used.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second method of standardization.</em>—Dilute 100 cc. of the stock
soap solution to 1 liter with 70 per cent alcohol. This dilute solution
should be of such strength that approximately 6.4 cc. of it will
give a permanent lather when 20 cc. of standard calcium chloride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>solution diluted to 50 cc. with distilled water is titrated with it.
Determine the amount of soap solution required to give a permanent
lather with 50 cc. of distilled water and with 5, 10, 15, and 20 cc.
of standard calcium chloride solution diluted to 50 cc. with distilled
water. Finally plot on cross-section paper a curve showing the
relation of various quantities of soap solution to corresponding
quantities of standard calcium carbonate solution and therefore to
parts per million of hardness.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Measure 50 cc. of the water into a 250 cc. bottle
and add to it soap solution in small quantities in precisely the same
manner as described under the standardization of the soap solution.
From the number of cubic centimeters of soap solution used obtain
from Table 6 or from the plotted curve the total hardness of the
water in parts per million of calcium carbonate.</p>

<p class='c009'>To avoid mistaking the false or magnesium end-point for the true
one<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> when adding the soap solution to waters containing magnesium
salts, read the burette after the titration is apparently finished, and
add about 0.5 cc. more of soap solution. If the end-point was due
to magnesium the lather will disappear. Soap solution must then
be added until the true end-point is reached. Usually the false
lather persists for less than five minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>If more than 7 cc. of soap solution is required for 50 cc. of the
water take less of the sample and dilute it to 50 cc. with distilled
water which has been recently boiled and cooled. This step reduces
somewhat the disturbing influence of magnesium,<a id='r107a' /><a href='#f107a' class='c015'><sup>[107a]</sup></a> which consumes
more soap than an equivalent weight of calcium.</p>

<p class='c009'>At best the soap method is not a precise test on account of the
different relative amounts of calcium and magnesium in different
waters. For hard waters, especially in connection with processes
for purification and softening, it is advised that this method be not
exclusively used. If the same water is frequently analyzed it may
be of assistance to standardize the soap solution against a mixture
of calcium and magnesium salts, the relative proportions of which
approximate those found in the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strength of the soap solution should be determined from
time to time, to make sure that it has not materially changed.
Record all results in parts per million of calcium carbonate.</p>

<p class='c009'>One English degree of hardness, Clark’s scale, is equivalent to 1
grain per Imperial gallon of calcium carbonate. One French degree
of hardness is equivalent to 1 part per 100,000 of calcium carbonate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>One German degree of hardness is equivalent to 1 part per 100,000
of calcium oxide, and multiplied by 17.9 gives parts per million of
calcium carbonate. The relations of these various scales are
indicated in Table 7.</p>

<p class='c009'>Because of the ease with which free carbon dioxide escapes from

mineral acids or certain salts are present correction must be made.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>At best, the results of the titration are uncertain because the

<p class='c009'>The acidity due to sulfates of iron and aluminium is equal to the

<h3 class='c010'>CHLORIDE.<a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c011'>Chloride in water and sewage has its origin in common salt, from
mineral deposits in the earth, from ocean vapors carried inland by
the wind, or from polluting materials like sewage and trade wastes,
which contain the salt used in the household and in manufacturing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Comparison of the chloride content of a water with that of other
waters in the vicinity known to be unpolluted frequently affords
useful information as to its sanitary quality. If, however, the
chloride normally exceeds 20 parts per million because of chloride-bearing
mineral deposits the chloride content of a water has little
sanitary significance.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Standard sodium chloride solution. Dissolve 16.48
grams of pure fused sodium chloride in 1 liter of distilled water.
Dilute 100 cc. of this stock solution to 1 liter in order to obtain a
standard solution each cubic centimeter of which contains 0.001
gram of chloride.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Standard silver nitrate solution. Dissolve about 2.40 grams
of silver nitrate crystals in 1 liter of distilled water. Standardize
this with the standard salt solution, and adjust, correcting for
volume (see p. <a href='#Page_43'>43</a>), so that 1 cc. will be exactly equivalent to
0.0005 gram of chloride.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Potassium chromate indicator. Dissolve 50 grams of neutral
potassium chromate in a little distilled water. Add enough silver
nitrate to produce a slight red precipitate. Filter and dilute the
filtrate to 1 liter with distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Aluminium hydroxide. Electrolyze ammonia-free water, using
aluminium electrodes. Wash the precipitate until it is free from
chloride, ammonia, and nitrite. Or dissolve 125 grams of potassium
or ammonium alum in 1 liter of distilled water. Precipitate the
aluminium by adding cautiously ammonium hydroxide. Wash
the precipitate in a large jar by successive additions and decantations
of distilled water until free from chloride, nitrite, and ammonia.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Add 1 cc. of potassium chromate indicator to 50 cc.
of the sample in a 6–inch white porcelain evaporating dish or a
150 cc. Erlenmeyer flask over a white surface. Titrate with the
silver nitrate solution under similar conditions of volume, light, and
temperature as were used in standardizing the silver nitrate until
a faint reddish coloration is perceptible. The detection of the end-point
is facilitated by comparison of the contents of the porcelain
dish with those of another dish containing the same quantity of
potassium chromate indicator in 50 cc. of distilled water. Some
analysts prefer to make the titration in a dark-room provided with
a yellow light. The end-point is very sharp by electric light and
also by daylight with photographic yellow glass. The titration may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>be made in Nessler tubes<a id='r68a' /><a href='#f68a' class='c015'><sup>[68a]</sup></a> if the solutions are standardized under
similar conditions.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the amount of chloride is very high use 25 cc., or even a smaller
quantity, dilute the volume taken to 50 cc. with distilled water.
If the amount of chloride is very low concentrate 250 cc. of the
sample to 50 cc. by evaporation. Rotate the liquid to make sure
that no residue remains undissolved on the walls of the dish, and,
if necessary, use a rubber-tipped glass rod to assist in this operation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chloride is determined by some observers by extracting with
hot distilled water the residue in the platinum dish in the determination
of the residue on evaporation and proceeding as just
described. This is permissible if a little sodium carbonate is added
before evaporation to prevent loss of chloride through decomposition
of magnesium chloride in the residue.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the sample has a color greater than 30 it should be decolorized
by shaking it thoroughly with washed aluminium hydroxide (3 cc.
to 500 cc. of the sample) and allowing the precipitate to settle.
Make the determination on a portion of the clarified sample, filtered
if necessary. If the sample is acid, neutralize it with sodium carbonate;
if hydroxide is present, add dilute sulfuric acid until the
cold liquid will just discharge the color of phenolphthalein. If the
presence of sulfide and sulfocyanate renders it necessary, make
proper corrections<a id='r24c' /><a href='#f24c' class='c015'><sup>[24c]</sup></a><a id='r100b' /><a href='#f100b' class='c015'><sup>[100b]</sup></a> or modifications in treatment.</p>

in which X = the correction in cubic centimeters of silver

the titration. If 50 cc. of the sample is titrated chloride (Cl) in

<p class='c011'>Iron occurs in natural waters in both ferrous and ferric condition,
depending on the source of the sample. In ground waters the iron
is usually in an unoxidized and soluble condition, sometimes combined
with carbonic or sulfuric acid, and also in combination with
organic matter. Many waters, especially those that have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>exposed to the air, contain the iron in the form of a colloidal hydroxide.
Silt-bearing waters often contain much iron in suspension,
usually in an oxidized form. Sewages and sewage effluents,
particularly those receiving manufacturing wastes, contain various
forms of iron of different degrees of solubility, oxidation, and coagulation.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>COLORIMETRIC METHOD.</h5>

<p class='c011'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Standard iron solution. Dissolve 0.7 gram of crystallized
ferrous ammonium sulfate in 50 cc. of distilled water to
which 20 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid has been added. Warm the
solution slightly and add potassium permanganate until the iron
is completely oxidized. Dilute the solution to 1 liter. One cc. of
the standard solution equals 0.1 mg. Fe.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Potassium sulfocyanide solution. Dissolve 20 grams of the
salt in 1 liter of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Dilute hydrochloric acid. One volume of acid (Sp. gr. 1.2) and
one volume of distilled water. This shall be free from nitric acid.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. N/5 potassium permanganate. Dissolve 6.30 grams of the
salt in distilled water and dilute to 1 liter.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Hydrochloric acid. Concentrated, free from iron.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Nitric acid. Concentrated, free from iron.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Nitric acid. 5N, free from iron.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>First procedure.</em>—Evaporate 100 cc. of the water to dryness, or
use the residue left after the determination of residue on evaporation
(p. <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>). Ignite the residue at a low red heat taking care not
to heat it hot enough to make the iron difficultly soluble. Cool the
dish and add 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Moisten the
inner surface of the dish. Warm the solution for two or three
minutes, and again moisten the inner surface of the dish by permitting
the hot acid to flow over it. Wash the hot solution from
the dish into a 50 cc. Nessler tube, filtering if necessary through
paper that has been washed with hot water. Dilute to 50 cc., and
add 3 drops of potassium permanganate solution. Add 5 cc. of
potassium sulfocyanide solution, mix, and compare with standards.</p>

<p class='c009'>If it is not convenient to use the residue on evaporation and if
the sample is relatively free from organic matter, boil 50 cc. of the
sample with 5 cc. of 5N nitric acid for five minutes. Add a few
drops of permanganate and 5 cc. of potassium sulfocyanide and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>compare with standards, using nitric acid in place of hydrochloric
acid in the standards. This method is excellent for ground waters.
The permanganate and acid liberate chlorine in water high in chloride,
and produce a permanent yellow color which interferes with the
determination, unless the sample is first diluted to 50 cc. An excess
of permanganate, reacting with hydrochloric acid, causes similar
trouble. The amounts of hydrochloric acid, 5 cc., and of sulfocyanide,
5 cc., should be approximately measured because more acid
lightens the color whereas more sulfocyanide deepens it. This is
especially important if permanent standards are used.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second procedure.</em>—For surface waters containing small amounts
of organic matter, the method of Klut<a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a> is recommended. Samples
containing small amounts of iron should be concentrated, if possible,
until at least 0.5 mg. of iron is present in the volume tested. Boil
the sample in a beaker with 2 to 3 cc. of concentrated nitric acid
free from iron, adding permanganate if necessary to destroy the
organic matter. To the hot liquid add ammonia in slight excess
and warm until the smell of ammonia is hardly discernible. Filter
and wash with water at 70° to 80° C. containing a little ammonia.
Dissolve the iron in the beaker and on the filter paper in 5 cc. of
concentrated hydrochloric acid, and wash with hot water until the
iron is all dissolved, collecting the filtrate in a 50 cc. Nessler tube.
Dilute to 50 cc. Add potassium sulfocyanide and determine the
iron by comparison with standards.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Comparison with iron standards.</span></h6>

<p class='c011'><em>First procedure.</em>—Prepare standards containing amounts of standard
iron solution ranging from 0.05 to 4 cc. according to the quantity
of iron in the sample. Dilute these amounts with water to about
40 cc. Add 5 cc. of dilute hydrochloric acid and 3 drops of potassium
permanganate to each tube and dilute to 50 cc. Add 5 cc. of the
potassium sulfocyanide to each of the standard solutions at the
same time that it is added to the samples of water under examination,
and compare immediately after mixing. If 100 cc. of the sample
is used the iron in parts per million is equal to the number of cubic
centimeters of the standard iron solution in the standard that the
sample matches.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second procedure.</em>—For a small number of determinations it is
more convenient to run the standard iron solution into a Nessler
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>tube containing the acid, distilled water, and potassium sulfocyanide
until the color matches that of the sample tested. When
determining iron in three or four samples the colors may be matched
in the order of their intensity and the volumes of standard iron
solution required for each tube may be read from the burette.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Comparison with permanent standards.</span></h6>

<p class='c009'>3. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of sulfuric acid, specific
gravity 1.84, with 5 parts of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Add 10 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid to 50 cc. of the
sample, remove the suspended matter by filtration if necessary,
and add 15 cc. of potassium ferricyanide solution. Dilute the solution

Add about 0.5 gram of ammonium persulfate crystals and warm
the solution until the maximum permanganate color is developed.

<p class='c011'>Determinations of lead, zinc, copper, and tin are important in
certain mining regions and in places where the water has a solvent
action on pipes and other containers. The use of certain “germicides”
also makes it necessary to test for some of these metals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lead, zinc, and copper may be determined colorimetrically or
electrolytically. The colorimetric methods are not so accurate as
a combination of both, and are chiefly of value as qualitative tests.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is possible to make a rough estimation of the amount of lead
in clear waters by acidifying with acetic acid, saturating with
hydrogen sulfide, and comparing the color produced with that
produced by standard lead solutions in Nessler tubes, treated in
similar manner. This method, however, is not applicable if the
water is colored or contains iron.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Standard lead solution. Dissolve 1.60 grams of
lead nitrate (Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) in 1 liter of distilled water. One cc. of this
solution contains 1 mg. of lead (Pb). As a check it is desirable to
determine lead as sulfate in a measured portion of this solution.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Standard copper solution. Dissolve about 0.8 gram of copper
sulfate crystals (CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O) in water and, after the addition of
1 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, dilute the solution to 1 liter.
Determine the copper in 100 cc. of this solution in the usual way

<p class='c011'>Concentrate (1)<a id='rD' /><a href='#fD' class='c015'><sup>[D]</sup></a> rapidly by boiling in a 7–inch porcelain dish
over a free flame 3 or 4 liters of the sample to be tested, or more if
very small amounts of the metals are present, to a volume of about
30 cc. Add 10 or 15 cc. of ammonium chloride solution to assist in
the separation of the sulfides, then add a few drops of concentrated
ammonium hydroxide, and saturate with hydrogen sulfide. Allow
to stand some time, preferably over night, add a little more ammonium
hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide, boil the contents of the
dish a few minutes, and filter. The precipitate (2) may consist
of lead, zinc, copper, and iron sulfides and the suspended organic
matter. The soluble coloring matter is in the filtrate (3). Wash
the precipitate a few times with hot water, place the precipitate
and the filter paper in the original dish and boil with dilute nitric
acid, rubbing down the sides of the dish, if necessary, to detach
any adhering sulfide precipitate. After again filtering and washing
several times with hot water, evaporate the filtrate and washings
in the original dish to a bulk of 10 to 15 cc., cool, add 5 cc. of concentrated
sulfuric acid, and heat until copious fumes of sulfuric
acid are evolved.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>If lead is present dilute the contents of the dish slightly with
water, and treat them with 150 cc. of 50 per cent alcohol, in which
the lead sulfate is insoluble. Allow to stand some time, preferably
over night, filter off the lead sulfate, and wash it with 50 per cent
alcohol. Save the filtrate for the determination of zinc.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dissolve the precipitate of lead sulfate by boiling the filter containing
it in ammonium acetate solution in a porcelain dish. (4).
Filter into a 50 cc. Nessler tube and wash the filter with boiling
water containing a little ammonium acetate. Divide this filtrate
in halves and treat one-half with saturated hydrogen sulfide water
in order to get an approximation of the amount of lead present.
To the other half, or an aliquot portion, if a large amount of lead is
present, add a few drops of acetic acid, then an excess of saturated
hydrogen sulfide solution, and compare the color with that of
standards made by treating known amounts of the standard lead
solution with a little acetic acid, ammonium acetate, and hydrogen
sulfide.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ZINC.</h4>

<p class='c011'>If zinc is present and copper is absent concentrate the filtrate
from the lead sulfate to expel the alcohol, and remove the iron by
adding an excess of ammonium hydroxide. Filter, wash, and acidify
the filtrate with sulfuric acid. Concentrate the filtrate to about
150 cc. and transfer to a weighed platinum dish. Add 2 grams of
potassium oxalate and 1.5 grams of potassium sulfate. Deposit the
zinc electrolytically by means of a current of about 0.3 ampere for
three hours. After deposition is complete and while the current
is on, siphon off the solution and at the same time run into the dish
a stream of distilled water in order to expel the free sulfuric acid,
which might dissolve some of the zinc if the circuit were broken.
After the acid has been removed break the circuit, wash the dish
with water, then with 95 per cent alcohol, dry at 70° C., cool, and
weigh it. The difference between this weight (10) and the weight
of the platinum dish equals the amount of metallic zinc. Some
difficulty has been experienced in this determination in obtaining
pure reagents. It is therefore advisable to make blank determinations
with each new lot of reagents and to correct the results if
necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>If copper also is present (5) concentrate the filtrate from the
lead sulfate until the alcohol is expelled, and add an excess of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>ammonium hydroxide. (6) Remove any iron precipitate by filtration.
Neutralize the filtrate (7) with sulfuric acid, and add 2 cc. of
concentrated sulfuric acid and 1 gram of urea. Electrolyze the
solution and determine copper colorimetrically as described in the
procedure for copper (p. <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>). After the copper has been deposited
add ammonium hydroxide to the solution containing the zinc until
nearly all the sulfuric acid has been neutralized, concentrate to
slightly less than the capacity of the platinum dish, add 1.5 grams
of potassium sulfate and 2 grams of potassium oxalate, and electrolyze
for zinc. As this solution is usually saturated with ammonium
salts due to neutralizing the large quantity of sulfuric acid,
it is frequently impossible to get the zinc deposited firmly on the
dish before the salts interfere by crystallization. To avoid this
difficulty, dilute half the solution and electrolyze it for zinc; or, if
the amount of zinc is very small, precipitate the zinc as sulfide in
acetic acid solution, wash, ignite to oxide, and weigh the precipitate.
This difficulty will not be encountered if copper is absent as there
will then be no excess of ammonium salts.</p>

<p class='c009'>If lead and copper are known to be absent and zinc alone is to be
determined (13), after treating with sulfuric acid for separation
of lead, slightly dilute the contents of the dish. Add an excess of
ammonium hydroxide to precipitate iron and filter. Make the
filtrate slightly acid with sulfuric acid, concentrate to about 150
cc., transfer to a weighed platinum dish, add potassium oxalate and
sulfate, and electrolyze the solution as described for deposition of
zinc.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>COPPER.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c011'>Use 1 liter of a sample containing 0.1 to 1.0 part per million of
copper, and proportionate amounts for other concentrations.
Evaporate to about 75 cc., and wash into a 100 cc. platinum dish.
Add 2 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid for clear and soft waters; add more
acid to very alkaline waters to offset the alkalinity; add 5 cc. of
acid to waters carrying much organic matter or clay to insure the
formation of a soluble copper salt. Then place the dish as the
anode in a direct current circuit, suspend a spiral wire cathode in
the solution so that it is parallel to and about half an inch from the
bottom of the dish, and close the circuit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Electrolyze for about four hours with occasional stirring, or over
night, if convenient. The current may be supplied by two gravity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>cells in series, yielding a current through the solution of about 0.02
ampere. Lift out the cathode without previously opening the circuit,
and immerse the spiral in a small amount of dilute nitric acid
previously heated to boiling. Wash off the wire and evaporate the
nitric acid solution to dryness on the water bath. If the presence
of silver is suspected add a few drops of hydrochloric acid before
evaporation. Dissolve the residue in water and wash it into a
50 cc. Nessler tube. Dilute to 50 cc. and add 10 cc. of the potassium
sulfide solution. The color of the copper sulfide develops at once
and is fairly permanent, lasting at least several hours. Add 10 cc.
of the potassium sulfide solution to a similar tube containing 50 cc.
of distilled water, and then add to it standard copper solution in
0.2 cc. portions until the colors of the two tubes match. If 1 liter
of the sample is used copper in parts per million is equal to the
number of cubic centimeters of standard copper solution required
to match the color of the sample multiplied by 0.2.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TIN.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Small quantities of tin are occasionally found in waters that have
passed through tin or tin-lined pipes. This metal, if present, is
precipitated with the iron by ammonia in the lead, zinc, and copper
separations. In the method for copper alone, it is removed in the
same way and may be further avoided by dissolving the sulfides in
concentrated nitric acid. Any tin present will then separate as an
insoluble compound, which may be ignited and weighed as the oxide
(SnO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

1 cc. of 10 per cent platinic chloride (PtCl<sub>4</sub>) for each 30 mg. of the
combined chlorides. Evaporate to a thick syrup on the water
bath, then remove dish and allow it to come to dryness at laboratory
temperature. Treat the residue cold with 80 per cent alcohol and
filter. Wash the precipitate with 80 per cent alcohol until the
filtrate is no longer colored. Dry the precipitate and dissolve it
in hot water. Evaporate the solution to dryness in a platinum
dish and weigh it as potassium platinic chloride (K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>). The
weight of potassium (K) is 16.1 per cent of this weight and the
equivalent of potassium chloride (KCl) is 30.7 per cent of this
weight. Subtract the equivalent weight of potassium chloride
from the weight of the combined chlorides. The weight of the
sodium is 39.4 per cent of the difference.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second procedure.</em><a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a><a id='r103a' /><a href='#f103a' class='c015'><sup>[103a]</sup></a>—Add to the hot solution of the combined
chlorides 20 per cent perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>) slightly in excess of
the amount required to combine with the bases. One cubic centimeter
of 20 per cent perchloric acid is equivalent to 90 mg. of
potassium. Evaporate the solution to dryness, dissolve the residue
in 10 cc. of hot water and a small amount of perchloric acid, and
again evaporate to dryness. Repeat the addition of water, perchloric
acid, and evaporation until white fumes appear on evaporating
to dryness. Add to the residue 25 cc. of 96 per cent alcohol containing
0.2 per cent of perchloric acid (1 cc. of 20 per cent perchloric
acid in 100 cc. of 98 per cent alcohol). Break up the residue with
a stirring rod. Decant the supernatant liquid through a weighed
Gooch crucible that has been washed with 0.2 per cent perchloric
acid in alcohol. If the precipitate is unusually large dissolve it in
hot water and repeat the evaporation with perchloric acid. Wash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the precipitate once by decantation with the 0.2 per cent perchloric
acid in alcohol, transfer the precipitate to the crucible, and wash it
several times with a 0.2 per cent perchloric acid in alcohol. Dry
the crucible at 120–130° C. for one hour, cool, and weigh it. The
increase in weight is potassium perchlorate (KClO<sub>4</sub>). The equivalent
weight of potassium is 28.2 per cent and the equivalent weight
of potassium chloride is 53.8 per cent of the potassium perchlorate.
Calculate the content of sodium by difference.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>LITHIUM.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c011'>Use a large quantity of the sample. Obtain the combined
chlorides of sodium, potassium, and lithium (see pp. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>–59).
Transfer the combined chlorides to a small Erlenmeyer flask (50
or 100 cc. capacity) and evaporate the solution nearly, but not
quite, to dryness. Add about 30 cc. of redistilled amyl alcohol.
Connect the flask, the stopper of which carries a thermometer, with
a condenser<a id='rE' /><a href='#fE' class='c015'><sup>[E]</sup></a> and boil until the temperature rises approximately to
the boiling point of amyl alcohol (130° C.), showing that all the
water has been driven off. Cool slightly and add a drop of hydrochloric
acid to convert small amounts of lithium hydroxide to
lithium chloride. Connect with the condenser and continue the
boiling to drive off again all water and until the temperature reaches
the boiling point of amyl alcohol. The content of the flask at this
time is usually 15 to 20 cc. Filter through a small paper or a
Gooch crucible into a graduated cylinder and note exact quantity
of filtrate, which determines the subsequent correction. Wash
the precipitate with small quantities of dehydrated amyl alcohol.
Evaporate the filtrate and washings in a platinum dish to dryness
on the steam bath, dissolve the residue in water, and add a few
drops of sulfuric acid. Evaporate on a steam bath and expel the
excess of sulfuric acid by gentle heat over a flame. Repeat until
carbonaceous matter is completely burned off. Cool and weigh
the dish and contents. Dissolve in a small quantity of hot water,
filter through a small filter, wash, and return filter to dish, ignite,
and weigh. The difference between the original weight of dish
and contents and the weight of the dish and small amount of
residue equals the weight of impure lithium sulfate. The purity
of the lithium sulfate should be tested by adding small amounts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>ammonium phosphate and ammonium hydroxide, which will precipitate
any magnesium present with the lithium sulfate. Any
precipitate appearing after standing over night should be collected
on a small filter and weighed as magnesium pyrophosphate, calculated
to sulfate, and subtracted from the weight of impure
lithium sulfate. From this weight subtract 0.00113 gram for
every 10 cc. of amyl alcohol filtrate exclusive of the amyl alcohol
used in washing residue because of the slight solubility of solid
mixed chlorides in amyl alcohol. Calculate lithium from the corrected
weight of lithium sulfate. Dissolve the mixed chlorides
from flask and filter with hot water, evaporate to dryness, ignite
gently to remove amyl alcohol, filter and thoroughly wash; concentrate
the filtrates and washings to 25 to 50 cc.</p>

quantities of a standard solution of potassium iodide in small tubes.
Add 3 or 4 drops of the potassium nitrite solution and extract
with carbon bisulfide as in the actual determination. Transfer to

<p class='c009'>5. Chlorine water. Saturated solution.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>6. Bromine standards. Add measured quantities of a standard
solution of a bromide to the liquid in each of the small flasks from
which the iodine has been removed. Add to each 5 cc. of purified
carbon bisulfide, and proceed exactly as with the sample.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Evaporate to dryness an aliquot portion of the
alkaline filtrate. Dissolve the residue in 2 or 3 cc. of water, and
add enough absolute alcohol to make the percentage of alcohol
about 90. Boil and filter and repeat the extraction of the residue
with alcohol once or twice. Add 2 or 3 drops of sodium hydroxide
to the combined alcoholic filtrates and evaporate to dryness.
Dissolve the residue in 2 or 3 cc. of water and repeat the extraction
with alcohol and the filtration. Add a drop of sodium hydroxide
to the filtrate and evaporate it to dryness. Dissolve the residue in
a little water. Acidify this solution with dilute sulfuric acid,
adding 3 or 4 drops excess, and transfer it to a small flask. Add
4 drops of the solution of potassium nitrite or sodium nitrite and
about 5 cc. of carbon bisulfide. Shake the mixture until all the
iodine is extracted. Separate the acid solution from the carbon
bisulfide by filtration. Wash the flask, filter, and contents with
cold distilled water, and transfer the carbon bisulfide containing
the iodine in solution to Nessler tubes by means of about 5 cc. of
pure carbon bisulfide. In washing the filter, dilute the contents
of the tube to a definite volume, usually 12 or 15 cc., and compare
the color with that of known amounts of iodine dissolved in carbon
bisulfide in other tubes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Transfer to a small flask the sample from which the iodine
has been removed. Add saturated chlorine water, 1 cc. at a time,
shaking after each addition until all the bromine is freed. Care
must be taken not to add much more chlorine than that necessary
to free the bromine, since an excess of reagent may form a bromochloride
that spoils the color reaction. Separate the water solution
from the carbon bisulfide by filtration through a moistened filter,
wash the contents of the filter two or three times with water, and
then transfer them to a Nessler tube by means of about 1 cc. of
carbon bisulfide. Repeat this extraction of the filtrate twice,
using 3 cc. of carbon bisulfide each time. The combined carbon
bisulfide extracts usually amount to 11.5 to 12 cc. Add enough
carbon bisulfide to the tubes to bring them to a definite volume,
usually 12 to 15 cc., and compare the sample with the standards.
If much bromine is present it is not always completely extracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>by the amounts of carbon bisulfide recommended. If the extraction
is incomplete, therefore, make one or two extra extractions with
carbon bisulfide, transfer the extracts to another tube, and compare
the color with that of the standards.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>ARSENIC.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a></h5>

<p class='c011'>Evaporate to dryness an aliquot portion of the alkaline filtrate
(p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>). Acidify the residue with arsenic-free sulfuric acid, and
subject it to the action of arsenic-free zinc and sulfuric acid in a
Marsh-Berzelius apparatus. Compare the mirror obtained with
a mirror obtained from an arsenious oxide solution of known
strength.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>BORIC ACID.</h5>

<p class='c011'>Evaporate to dryness an aliquot portion of the alkaline filtrate
(p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>), treat the residue with 1 or 2 cc. of water, and slightly
acidify the solution with hydrochloric acid. Add about 25 cc. of
absolute alcohol, boil, filter, and repeat the extraction of the
residue. Make the filtrate slightly alkaline with sodium hydroxide,
and evaporate it to dryness. Add a little water, slightly acidify
with hydrochloric acid, and place a strip of turmeric paper in the
liquid. Evaporate to dryness on the steam bath, and continue
the heating until the turmeric paper is dry. If boric acid is present
the turmeric paper becomes cherry red. It is not usually necessary
to determine quantitatively boric acid; the quantitative method
devised by Gooch<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> is recommended.</p>

iodine solution and 1 gram of potassium iodide in a large glass-stoppered
bottle or flask. If the sample is to be collected from
a tap lead the water into the bottle through a rubber tube extending
to the bottom of the bottle so as to eliminate errors due to
aeration. Shake the bottle, allow it to stand for a few minutes,
and then titrate the excess of iodine with sodium thiosulfate in the
presence of starch indicator. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in parts per
million is equal to 0.34 times the difference in cubic centimeters
between the amount of iodine solution added and the amount of
N/100 thiosulfate used in the titration.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CHLORINE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In waters that have been treated with calcium hypochlorite or
liquid chlorine it is frequently advisable to ascertain the presence
or absence of chlorine. As the reagents which have been proposed
for its detection are not specific for chlorine but give
similar or identical reactions with oxidizing agents or reducible
substances care must be exercised in interpreting the results of
such tests: nitrites and ferric salts are of common occurrence, and
chlorates also may lead to misinterpretation in waters treated with
calcium hypochlorite.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Reagents.</em>—1. Tolidin solution. One gram of o-tolidin, purified
by being recrystallized from alcohol, is dissolved in 1 liter of 10 per
cent hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Copper sulfate solution. Dissolve 1.5 grams of copper sulfate
and 1 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in distilled water and dilute
the solution to 100 cc.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Potassium bichromate solution. Dissolve 0.025 gram of
potassium bichromate and 0.1 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in
distilled water and dilute the solution to 100 cc.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Mix 1 cc. of the tolidin reagent with 100 cc. of the
sample in a Nessler tube and allow the solution to stand at least
5 minutes. Small amounts of free chlorine give a yellow and
larger amounts an orange color.</p>

<p class='c009'>For quantitative determination compare the color with that
of standards in similar tubes prepared from the solutions of copper
sulfate and potassium bichromate. The amounts of solution for

dilute the solution to 1 liter with freshly boiled distilled water.
Each cc. is equivalent to 0.2 mg. of oxygen or to 0.1395 cc. of oxygen
at 0°C. and 760 mm. pressure. Inasmuch as this solution is
not permanent it should be standardized occasionally against a
N/40 solution of potassium bichromate. The keeping qualities of
the thiosulfate solution are improved by adding to each liter 5 cc.
of chloroform and 1.5 grams of ammonium carbonate before diluting
to the prescribed volume.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Starch solution. Mix a small amount of clean starch with
cold water until it becomes a thin paste and stir this mass into 150
to 200 times its weight of boiling water. Boil for a few minutes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>then sterilize. It may be preserved by adding a few drops of
chloroform.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Collection of sample.</em>—Collect the sample in a narrow-necked
glass-stoppered bottle of 250 to 270 cc. capacity. The following
procedure should be followed in order to avoid entrainment or
absorption of atmospheric oxygen. In collecting from a tap fill
the bottle through a glass or rubber tube extending well into the
tap and to the bottom of the bottle. To avoid air bubbles allow
the bottle to overflow for several minutes, and then carefully replace
the glass stopper so that no air bubble is entrained. In collecting
from the surface of a pond or tank connect the sample bottle to
a bottle of 1 liter capacity. Provide each bottle with a two-hole
rubber stopper having one glass tube extending to the bottom and
another glass tube entering but not projecting into the bottle.
Connect the short tube of the sample bottle with the long tube
of the liter bottle. Immerse the sample bottle in the water and
apply suction to the outlet of the liter bottle. To collect a sample
at any depth arrange the two bottles so that the outlet tube of
the liter bottle is at a higher elevation then the inlet tube of the
sample bottle. Lower the two bottles, in any convenient form
of cage properly weighted, to the desired depth. Water entering
during the descent will be flushed through into the liter bottle.
When air bubbles cease rising to the surface raise the bottles.
Finally replace the perforated stopper of the sample bottle with
a glass stopper in such manner as to avoid entraining bubbles of air.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Remove the stopper from the bottle and add, first,
0.7 cc. of the concentrated sulfuric acid, and then 1 cc. of the potassium
permanganate solution. These and all other reagents should
be introduced by pipette under the surface of the liquid. Insert
the stopper and mix by inverting the bottle several times. After
20 minutes have elapsed destroy the excess of permanganate by
adding 1 cc. of the potassium oxalate solution, the bottle being
at once restoppered and its contents mixed. If a noticeable excess
of potassium permanganate is not present at the end of 20 minutes,
again add 1 cc. of the potassium permanganate solution. If this is
still insufficient use a stronger potassium permanganate solution.
After the liquid has been decolorized by the addition of potassium
oxalate add 1 cc. of the manganous sulfate solution and 3 cc.
of the alkaline potassium iodide solution. Allow the precipitate
to settle. Add 2 cc. of the hydrochloric acid and mix by shaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>The procedure to this point must be carried out in the field, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>after the acid has been added and the stopper replaced there is no
further change, and the rest of the test may be performed within
a few hours, as convenient. Transfer 200 cc. of the contents of
the bottle to a flask and titrate with N/40 sodium thiosulfate,
using a few cubic centimeters of the starch solution as indicator
toward the end of the titration. Do not add the starch solution
until the color has become faint yellow, and titrate until the blue
color disappears.</p>

<p class='c009'>The use of potassium permanganate is made necessary by high
nitrite or organic matter. The procedure outlined must be followed
in all work on sewage and partly purified effluents or seriously
polluted streams or samples whose nitrite nitrogen exceeds 0.1
part per million. In testing other samples the procedure may be
shortened by beginning with the addition of the manganous sulfate
solution and proceeding from that point as outlined, except that
only 1 cc. of alkaline potassium iodide need be added.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Calculation of Results.</em>—Oxygen shall be reported in parts per
million by weight. It is sometimes convenient to know the number
of cubic centimeters per liter of the gas at 0°C. temperature and
760 mm. pressure and also to know the percentage which the
amount of gas present is of the maximum amount capable of
being dissolved by distilled water at the same temperature and
pressure. If 200 cc. of the sample is taken the number of cubic
centimeters of N/40 thiosulfate used is equal to parts per million
of oxygen. Corrections for volume of reagents added amount to
less than 3 per cent and are not justified except in work of unusual
precision. To obtain the result in cubic centimeters per liter
multiply the number of cubic centimeters of thiosulfate used by
0.698. To obtain the result in percentage of saturation divide
the number of cubic centimeters of thiosulfate by the figure in
Table 14 opposite the temperature of the water and under the
proper chlorine figure. The last column of Table 14 permits
interpolation for intermediate chlorine values. At elevations
differing considerably from mean sea level and for accurate work
attention must be given to barometric pressure, the normal pressure
in the region being preferable to the specific pressure at the time
of sampling. The term “saturation” refers to a condition of
equilibrium between the solution and an oxygen pressure in the
atmosphere corresponding to 158.8 millimeters, or approximately
one-fifth atmosphere. The true saturation or equilibrium between
the solution and pure oxygen is nearly five times this value, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>consequently values in excess of 100 per cent saturation frequently
occur in the presence of oxygen-forming plants.</p>

dish to a volume of about 50 cc. By means of a rubber-tipped
glass rod remove to the bottom of the dish the solid matter

the alkalinity. Do not use an excess of acid. Then evaporate
the contents of the dish to dryness. Treat the dry residue with
boiling ether, rubbing the bottom and sides of the dish to insure
complete solution of fat. Three extractions with ether are required.
Filter the ether solution through a 5 cm. filter into a weighed
flask having a wide mouth. Evaporate the ether slowly, and dry
the flask at 100° C. for 30 minutes. The increase in weight of the
flask gives the amount of fats, or, in more precise language, the

<p class='c011'><em>Reagent.</em>—Methylene blue solution. A 0.05 per cent aqueous
solution of methylene blue, preferably the double zinc salt or
commercial variety.<a id='r60b' /><a href='#f60b' class='c015'><sup>[60b]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Collection of sample.</em>—Collect the sample in a glass-stoppered
bottle holding approximately 150 cc. If the dissolved oxygen is
low observe precautions similar to those used in collecting samples
for dissolved oxygen (p. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>).</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Add 0.4 cc. of the methylene blue solution to the
sample in the 150 cc. bottle. As methylene blue has a slightly
antiseptic property be careful to add exactly 0.4 cc. Add the
methylene blue solution preferably below the surface of the liquid
after filling the bottle with the sample. If the methylene blue
is added first do not allow the liquid to overflow as coloring matter
will thus be lost. Incubate the sample at 20° C. for ten days.
Four days’ incubation may be considered sufficient for all practical
purposes in routine plant-control work. If quick results are
desired incubate the sample at 37° C. for five days using suitable
stoppers<a id='r1a' /><a href='#f1a' class='c015'><sup>[1a]</sup></a><a href='#f2a' class='c015'><sup>[2a]</sup></a> to prevent the loss and reabsorption of dissolved
oxygen. The bacterial flora at 37° C. is different from that
at 20° C. The lower temperature is more nearly the average
temperature of surface waters and therefore the higher temperature
should be used only when quick approximate results are essential.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Observe the sample at least twice a day during incubation. Give
a sample in which the methylene blue becomes decolorized a
relative stability corresponding to the time required for reduction
(see Table 15). For routine filter control ordinary room or cellar
temperature gives fairly satisfactory results. For accurate studies,
room temperature incubation is very undesirable, as the fluctuations
in temperature which are ordinarily not noticed are
responsible for appreciable deviations from the true values of
relative stability. If the samples are incubated less than 10 days
at 20° C. and are not decolorized place a plus sign after the stability
value in order to indicate that the stability might have been higher
if more time had been allowed. In applying this test to river waters
it often happens that the blue coloring matter is removed either
partly or completely through absorption by the clay which many
rivers carry in suspension. True relative stabilities cannot be
obtained for such waters except by determining the initial available
oxygen at the start and the biochemical oxygen demand on
incubation at 20° C. for 10 days (pp. <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>–73). Germicides, such as
hypochlorite of lime, if present in sufficient quantity, vitiate the
results. If a sample contains free chlorine, therefore, store it
about 2 hours, or until the chlorine is gone, and then add methylene
blue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Table 15<a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a> gives the relation between the time in days to decolorize
methylene blue at 20° C. (<em>t</em><sub>20</sub>) and the relative stability
number or ratio of available oxygen to oxygen required for equilibrium,
expressed in percentage (S).</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RELATIVE STABILITY METHOD.</h4>

<p class='c011'>The relative stability method may be employed to obtain a
measure of the putrescible material in sewages and effluents in
terms of oxygen demand.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure for effluents.</em>—Divide the total available oxygen,
including the oxygen of nitrite and nitrate, by the relative stability
expressed as a decimal.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure for sewages.</em>—Make one or two dilutions with fully
aerated distilled water of known dissolved oxygen content. Tap
water may be employed if it is free from nitrates. Vary the relative
proportions of sewage and water to be employed to give a relative
stability of 50 to 75. Unless seals<a id='r1b' /><a href='#f1b' class='c015'><sup>[1b]</sup></a><a id='r2b' /><a href='#f2b' class='c015'><sup>[2b]</sup></a><a id='r52a' /><a href='#f52a' class='c015'><sup>[52a]</sup></a> are used bring the water
as well as the sewage to the temperature at which the mixtures
are to be incubated before preparing the dilutions. During
the manipulation avoid aeration. Having made the proper dilutions,
determine the relative stability of each.</p>

<p class='c009'>Calculate the oxygen demand in parts per million by the formula:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Oxygen demand = O(1 − p)/Rp</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In this formula, O is the initial dissolved oxygen of the diluting
water, p is the proportion of sewage; and R is the relative stability
of the mixture. Ordinarily the available oxygen in crude sewages,
septic tank effluents, settling tank effluents, and trade wastes can
be neglected.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>SODIUM NITRATE METHOD.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For the determination of the biochemical oxygen demand the
sodium nitrate method may be used<a href='#f60a' class='c015'><sup>[60a]</sup></a><a href='#f60c' class='c015'><sup>[60c]</sup></a><a href='#f60d' class='c015'><sup>[60d]</sup></a><a href='#f52a' class='c015'><sup>[52a]</sup></a>. The method
is based on the biochemical consumption of oxygen from sodium
nitrate by a sewage or polluted water during an incubation period
of ten days at 20° C. A reasonable excess of sodium nitrate does
not give a higher oxygen demand, as do higher dilutions with
aerated water. The oxygen absorbed from the air in applying the
method to sewages is negligible.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Reagent.</em>—Sodium nitrate solution. Dissolve 26.56 grams of
pure sodium nitrate in 1 liter of distilled water. One cc. of this
solution in 250 cc. of sewage represents 50 parts per million of
available oxygen. The strength of the sodium nitrate solution
may be varied to suit conditions.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure for sewages.</em>—Ordinarily disregard the initial available
oxygen as it is very small compared with the total biochemical
oxygen demand. Add measured amounts of the sodium nitrate
solution to the sewage in bottles holding approximately 250 cc.
which have been completely filled and stoppered. Incubate for
10 days at 20° C. A seal is not required during incubation. The
appearance of a black sediment and the development of a putrid
odor during incubation indicates that too little sodium nitrate has
been added. Methylene blue solution in proper proportion may
be added at the start to serve as an indicator during the incubation.
Domestic sewage usually varies in its oxygen demand from 100 to
300 parts per million, approximately 30 per cent of which is used
up at 20° C. in the first 24 hours. At the end of the incubation
period determine the residual nitrite and nitrate. Determine
the nitrate by the aluminium reduction method and direct
Nesslerization. To convert the nitrogen into oxygen equivalents,
multiply the nitrite nitrogen by 1.7 and the nitrate nitrogen by 2.9.
The difference between the available oxygen added as sodium nitrate
and that found as nitrite and nitrate at the end of the incubation
period is the biochemical oxygen demand.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure for industrial wastes.</em>—Employ the same procedure
using larger quantities of the sodium nitrate solution. Make the
reaction alkaline to methyl orange and acid to phenolphthalein.
Adjust an acid reaction with sodium bicarbonate and a caustic
alkaline reaction with weak hydrochloric acid. If the liquid is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>devoid of sewage bacteria seed it with sewage after adjusting the
reaction.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure for polluted river waters.</em>—Determine the initial available
oxygen. Unless the river water is badly polluted add 10 parts
per million of sodium nitrate oxygen. Collect carefully, avoiding
aeration, three samples in 250 cc. bottles. To one sample add a
definite quantity of sodium nitrate solution and incubate. Incubate
the other two samples for the determination of the residual
free oxygen, nitrite, and nitrate. If there is free oxygen left, the
bottle containing the sodium nitrate solution may be discarded.
If there is no free oxygen determine residual nitrite and nitrate
as directed under the procedure for sewage (p. <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>) and calculate
the oxygen demand.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ANALYSIS OF SEWAGE SLUDGE AND MUD DEPOSITS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>COLLECTION OF SAMPLE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Collect a representative sample of the material. In general more
than one sample should be taken from a spot and a large number
of samples should be collected rather than a few large samples.
If the surface layer is darker and a lower layer consists of pure
clay sample only the surface layer. Samples may be analyzed
either separately or as composites of careful mixtures. After the
sample has settled a few minutes roughly drain or siphon the excess
water. Allow sewage sludge to stand for one hour before draining
it free from excess water unless it is essential to determine the
moisture content of the sample originally collected. If sludge
cannot be analyzed within twenty-four hours it is better not to
use air-tight bottles and to add small quantities of chloroform and
keep in the ice box to retard decomposition. At the time of collection
carefully examine mud from the bottom of surface water for
evidence of sewage pollution and macroscopic and microscopic animal
and plant organisms. Record the predominant species. Note the
physical appearance of the material, particularly its color, odor,
and consistency. Express all analytical results in percentage on a
dry basis.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>REACTION.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Determine the reaction by diluting a definite quantity of the
wet sludge and titrating by the methods given under alkalinity and
acidity (pp. <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>–39 and 39–41).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>SPECIFIC GRAVITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Weigh to the nearest tenth of a gram a wide-mouthed flask of
100 to 300 cc. capacity, according to the quantity of material
available. Then completely fill the flask with distilled water
to the brim and weigh it again. Empty the flask and fill it completely
with fresh sewage sludge or mud. If the material is of such
consistency that it flows readily fill the flask to the brim and weigh.
The specific gravity is equal to the weight of the sludge or mud
divided by the weight of an equal volume of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the material does not flow readily fill the weighed flask as
completely as possible without exerting pressure during the procedure.
Weigh and then fill the flask to the brim with distilled
water. Let it stand for a few minutes, until trapped air has
escaped, then add more water if necessary and weigh. Subtract
the weight of the added water from the weight of the water that
completely fills the flask; the specific gravity is equal to the weight
of the material divided by this difference. Record the specific
gravity only to the second decimal place.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MOISTURE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Heat approximately 25 grams of sludge or mud in a weighed
nickel dish on the water bath until it is fairly dry. Dry the residue
in an oven at 100° C., cool, and weigh. Repeat to approximate
constant weight. The loss in weight is moisture.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>VOLATILE AND FIXED MATTER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Ignite, at dull red heat in a hood, the residue from the determination
of moisture until all the carbon has disappeared. Cool the
residue in a desiccator and weigh it. The residue is the fixed matter.
The volatile matter is the difference in weight between the original
dried sludge and the ignited sludge.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TOTAL ORGANIC NITROGEN.</h3>

<p class='c011'><em>Preparation of sample.</em>—For the determination of organic nitrogen
and fats dry approximately 50 to 75 grams of the sludge or mud in a
porcelain dish first on the water bath and finally in the hot-water
oven until all the moisture has disappeared. Grind the dry
material to a fine powder and keep it in a glass-stoppered bottle.</p>

</table>

<p class='c009'><em>First procedure.</em>—Weigh accurately 0.5 gram of dried sludge or 5.0
grams of dried mud and put it into a 500 cc. Kjeldahl flask. Digest
it with 20 cc. of sulfuric acid, or more if necessary, and 1 cc. of
copper sulfate solution to assist the oxidation. Boil for several
hours until the liquid becomes colorless or slightly yellow. Oxidize
the residue with 0.5 gram of potassium permanganate, and follow
the “Procedure for Sewage” (pp. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>–22).</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Second procedure.</em>—The following method is convenient for routine
work at sewage disposal plants. After digestion as described in
the first procedure, cool, transfer to a glass-stoppered 100 cc. flask,
dilute with distilled water to 100 cc., and mix well. Transfer 50 cc.
with a pipette into another 100 cc. volumetric flask, and make
this portion alkaline with 50 per cent sodium hydroxide, testing a
drop of the liquid on a porcelain plate with phenolphthalein to
insure neutralization. The formation of a floc usually indicates
that neutralization is complete. Dilute the solution to 100 cc.,
pour it into a small glass-stoppered bottle and permit it to stand
until the next day. Nesslerize an aliquot portion of the clear supernatant
liquid, and calculate the percentage of nitrogen in the material.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ETHER-SOLUBLE MATTER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Fats are usually determined only on sewage sludge, but some
mud deposits contain small quantities due to the presence of trade
wastes.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Weigh 0.5 to 25 grams of dry material according to
the quality of the sludge or mud. Add water to the weighed
portion in a porcelain dish and acidify the mixture with N/50
sulfuric acid in the presence of litmus tincture or azolitmin solution
as indicator. Avoid adding too much acid as an excess gives too high
results on account of fatty acid residues. Evaporate the acidified
mixture to dryness on the water bath, and heat it in the hot air
oven at 100° C. two to three hours. Extract the dry residue with
boiling ether, rubbing the sides and bottom of the dish to insure
complete solution of the fat. Three extractions with ether are
usually sufficient. Filter the ether solution through a 5 cm. filter
paper into a small flask. Evaporate the ether slowly, dry the fatty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>extract for half an hour at 100° C., cool in a desiccator, and weigh.
If it is desirable, particularly with certain industrial wastes, to determine
the quantity of saponified fat determine the fats with and
without the addition of acid. The difference between the quantities
found by the two determinations is the content of saponified
fat.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FERROUS SULFIDE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The liberation of hydrogen sulfide on adding dilute hydrochloric
acid to a sludge indicates the presence of ferrous sulfide. As ferrous
sulfide quickly oxidizes on exposure to air a quantitative
determination of this constituent must be made immediately after
collection of the sample.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Heat a definite portion of the sludge with hydrochloric
acid in a flask. Pass the liberated gas through bromine
water or hydrogen peroxide. Determine gravimetrically the sulfate
in the oxidizing solution, and calculate the equivalent of ferrous
sulfide by multiplying the weight of barium sulfate by 0.376.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The quantity of river mud most suitable for the determination
of the biochemical oxygen demand ranges within certain limits,
largely according to the amount of oxidizable matter present. For
examinations of river mud prepare a 1 per cent stock suspension
in distilled water or tap water saturated with oxygen and free from
nitrate; use in the test a dilution of this stock suspension equivalent
to a concentration of 1 to 10 grams per liter of mud. For
examinations of fresh sewage sludge prepare a 1 per cent stock suspension
in a similar manner, but use in the test a dilution equivalent
to only 0.1 to 1.0 gram per liter of wet material. For examinations
of dried sludges, which have undergone more or less oxidation
higher concentrations may be required.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Place a measured portion of the sample, or the
proper amount of the 1 per cent stock suspension of the sample, in
a 300 cc. narrow-mouth glass-stoppered bottle, and dilute it to the
desired concentration with water saturated with oxygen. Determine
the oxygen content at 20° C. of the waters that are used for dilution.
This determination must be made before the mud or sludge is added
because iron sulfide in the mud or sludge rapidly consumes part
of the dissolved oxygen. Incubate at 20° C. for five days.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Shortly before the determination of the oxygen remaining in
solution at the end of five days rotate the bottle once or twice
to mix its contents and allow sedimentation for about 30 minutes.
Siphon the greater part of the liquid through a narrow-bore siphon
into a 150 cc. bottle, which has been filled with carbon dioxide.
Reject the first 25 cc. of the siphoned liquid and allow a little to
overflow at the end of siphoning. Determine the oxygen content
of the solution in the bottle in the usual way (pp. <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>–68). Report
the oxygen demand in percentage of the dried mud or sludge.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The following sections describe the accepted methods for the
analysis of the chemicals commonly used in the treatment of water.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>REAGENTS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>1. Distilled water. In practically all the tests of chemicals it is
necessary to use exclusively distilled water that has been freshly
boiled to free it from carbon dioxide and oxygen.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Concentrated hydrochloric acid. Sp. gr. 1.20.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Hydrochloric acid, N/2.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Hydrochloric acid, N/10.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Ammonium hydroxide. Redistilled; sp. gr. 0.90.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of concentrated sulfuric
acid with 3 parts of freshly boiled distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Methyl orange indicator. See page <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. Phenolphthalein indicator. See page <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Bromine water.</p>

<p class='c009'>10. Stannous chloride, N/20. This should be frequently standardized
by titration against a standard iron solution. One cc. of
N/20 stannous chloride is equal to 0.0028 gram of iron (Fe)
estimated in the ferrous state.</p>

<p class='c009'>11. Sodium hydroxide, N/1. Free from carbonate. This should
be frequently standardized by titration against a standard acid
solution in presence of phenolphthalein indicator. One cc. of N/1
sodium hydroxide is equal to 0.049 gram of sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>),
or to 0.03645 gram of hydrochloric acid (HCl).</p>

<p class='c009'>12. Sodium hydroxide, N/20. Free from carbonate.</p>

<p class='c009'>13. Standard potassium permanganate. A N/10 solution. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>cc. of N/10 potassium permanganate is equal to 0.0056 gram of
iron (Fe) estimated in the ferrous state.</p>

<p class='c009'>14. Alcohol. Ethyl alcohol, 95 per cent.</p>

<p class='c009'>15. Sugar. Solid granulated cane sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>SULFATE OF ALUMINIUM.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Determine and report insoluble matter, aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>),
ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), ferrous oxide (FeO), basicity ratio, and, if
present, free acid as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. If the material is what is known as
“granular” sulfate mix it well before sampling. If it is in lump
form crush it to ⅛ to ¼ inch size, mix, and sample it. It is
unnecessary to grind the sample to a fine powder, but it is preferable
to have the particles fairly uniform in size.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>INSOLUBLE MATTER.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Treat 10 grams of the sample with 100 cc. of distilled water and
digest one hour at boiling temperature. Filter through a weighed
Gooch crucible and wash the insoluble matter with hot water freshly
boiled to free it from carbon dioxide. Dry the crucible to constant
weight at 100° C., cool, and weigh. Report the percentage of
insoluble matter.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>OXIDES OF IRON AND ALUMINIUM.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dilute the filtrate from the determination of insoluble matter
to 500 cc. with water free from carbon dioxide and thoroughly mix
the solution. Transfer 50 cc. of the solution to a 250 cc. beaker,
add about 150 cc. of water and 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric
acid, and heat to boiling. Add ammonium hydroxide in slight
excess; when the solution has been almost neutralized it is convenient
to add a drop of methyl orange indicator and then to add
about 0.5 cc. of ammonium hydroxide after the solution is neutral
to the indicator. Digest at about 100° C. for a few minutes and
filter. Some analysts prefer to wash this gelatinous precipitate with
hot water by decantation, and some to wash it evenly distributed
over the surface of a filter paper; either method may be used. It
is difficult to free it completely from impurities and it is not necessary
to do so unless unusual quantities of calcium, magnesium, sodium,
or potassium are present. While the precipitate is being washed
do not allow it to become dry, as it then packs and can not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>be washed clean. After most of the water has drained drying the
filter may be hastened by placing it on a sheet of blotting paper.
If much iron is present completely dry the precipitate, remove it
from the paper, and ignite the paper separately. Finally, blast
the precipitate, with free access of air to the crucible, for five or
ten minutes, cool, and weigh as oxides of iron and aluminium
(Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p class='c009'>Subtract the content of total iron, expressed as ferric oxide
(Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), from the weight of the combined oxides and report the
difference as aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), in percentage.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>TOTAL IRON.</h4>

<p class='c011'>As filter alum usually contains 0.2 to 0.3 per cent of iron use a
10 gram sample for the determination of total iron. Treat the
sample with 50 cc. of freshly boiled distilled water and add 5 cc. of
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 cc. of bromine water. Evaporate
the solution to dryness, dissolve the residue in water, and wash it
into a flask with sufficient water to make the volume about 50 cc.
Add 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, boil to expel oxygen,
and titrate, as hot as possible, with N/20 stannous chloride.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a 10 gram sample is used the percentage of iron (Fe) is equal
to the number of cubic centimeters of stannous chloride used
multiplied by 0.028, and the percentage of iron expressed as ferric
oxide is equal to the number of cubic centimeters of stannous
chloride used multiplied by 0.040.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>FERRIC IRON.</h4>

<p class='c011'>As filter alum usually contains 0.02 to 0.04 per cent of ferric iron
use a 20 gram sample. Boil 50 cc. of distilled water to expel
oxygen, add 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and add the
sample while the solution is boiling. Keep it boiling till the sample
is dissolved. The flask should be kept filled with carbon dioxide
during this process by dropping in occasionally small amounts of
sodium carbonate. When solution of the sample is complete
titrate it hot immediately with N/20 stannous chloride.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a 20 gram sample is used the percentage of ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
is equal to the number of cubic centimeters of stannous chloride
used multiplied by 0.020.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>FERROUS IRON.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The content of ferrous iron is the difference between total and
ferric iron. The percentage of ferrous oxide (FeO) is, therefore,
equal to 0.90 times the difference between the percentage of total
iron expressed as ferric oxide and the percentage of ferric iron
expressed as ferric oxide. Report the percentage of ferrous oxide
(FeO).</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BASICITY RATIO.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Transfer 50 cc. of the filtrate from the determination of insoluble
matter to a 200 cc. casserole and dilute it to 100 cc. Boil the
solution and titrate it at boiling temperature with N/1 sodium
hydroxide in presence of phenolphthalein indicator. The percentage
of acidity in equivalent of sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is equal to the
number of cubic centimeters of sodium hydroxide used multiplied
by 4.9. In this titration iron and aluminium are precipitated as
hydroxides and any free acid is neutralized.</p>

<p class='c009'>Calculate the percentage of sulfuric acid equivalent to the
determined percentages of aluminium oxide, ferric oxide, and
ferrous oxide by the following formula:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>2.88 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 1.83 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 1.36 FeO.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If this percentage of acid equivalent is less than that found by
titration report the difference as percentage of free acid. If the
percentage of acid equivalent is greater than that found by titration
the difference divided by 2.88 is the percentage equivalent to the
excess of aluminium oxide present. Divide this excess by the
percentage of total aluminium oxide and report the quotient as the
basicity ratio.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>LIME.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mix well the sample, which should contain no lumps. If foreign
matter is present grind the sample to pass a 100–mesh sieve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Place 20 grams of granulated cane sugar and 1 gram of the sample
in a 250 cc. glass-stoppered bottle, tightly stopped, and mix the
mass by rolling. Do not shake hard as much of the lime could
thus be lost as dust. Then add 187.4 cc. of distilled water freshly
boiled to expel carbon dioxide. This makes 200 cc. of sugar
solution. The lime is mixed dry with the sugar and the water
added later to keep the lime from lumping. After shaking the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>acid in presence of methyl orange indicator. The acid used is
equivalent to the carbonate and hydroxide in 0.25 gram of the
sample.</p>

<p class='c009'>Filter the remainder of the sugar solution, discarding the first 25
cc. of filtrate. Titrate 50 cc. of the filtrate with N/2 hydrochloric
acid in presence of methyl orange indicator. The acid used is
equivalent to the hydroxide in 0.25 gram of the sample.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a 1 gram sample is used the percentage of calcium oxide (CaO)
is equal to 5.6 times the number of cubic centimeters of hydrochloric
acid used in the second titration; and the percentage of calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) equivalent to the carbonate present is equal
to 10 times the difference in cubic centimeters between the results
of the two titrations.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>IRON AS FERROUS SULFATE.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dissolve 1 gram of the sample and dilute to 200 cc. with freshly
boiled distilled water cooled to 30° C. or less. Add 5 cc. of dilute
sulfuric acid (1 to 3) to a 50 cc. portion of the solution and titrate
with N/10 potassium permanganate. The percentage of ferrous
sulfate (FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O) is equal to 11.12 times the number of cubic
centimeters of potassium permanganate used.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ACIDITY.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Shake 12.25 grams of the sample in a 150 cc. bottle with 75 cc.
of 95 per cent alcohol for ten minutes. Run a blank. Filter
rapidly both sample and blank and wash rapidly with alcohol
sufficient to make 100 cc. of filtrate. Titrate with N/20 sodium
hydroxide in presence of phenolphthalein and subtract the result
of titrating the blank from that of titrating the solution of the
sample. The percentage of acidity, expressed as sulfuric acid
(H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), is equal to 0.02 times the number of cubic centimeters of
sodium hydroxide used.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The microscopical examination of water consists of the enumeration
of the kinds of microscopic organisms (Plankton), and an estimation
of their quantity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may serve any one or more of the following purposes:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>To explain the presence of objectionable odors and tastes.
    </dd>
    <dt>(2)</dt>
    <dd>To indicate the progress of the self purification of streams.
    </dd>
    <dt>(3)</dt>
    <dd>To indicate the presence of sewage contamination.
    </dd>
    <dt>(4)</dt>
    <dd>To explain the chemical analysis.
    </dd>
    <dt>(5)</dt>
    <dd>To identify the source of a water.
    </dd>
    <dt>(6)</dt>
    <dd>To aid in the study of the food of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic organisms.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c009'>The term “Microscopic Organisms” shall include all organisms
microscopic or barely visible to the naked eye, with the exception of
the bacteria. It includes the diatomaceae, chlorophyceae, cyanophyceae,
fungi, protozoa, rotifera, crustacea, bryophyta, and
spongidae found in water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fragments of organic matter, silt, mineral matter, zoöglea, etc.,
shall be considered as amorphous matter. The recording of amorphous
matter usually serves no useful purpose and shall not be
considered a part of the standard method.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Apparatus.</em>—1. A cylindrical funnel about two inches in diameter
at the top, with a straight side for nine inches, narrowed over a distance
of three inches to a bore of one-half inch in diameter, and
terminating in a straight portion of this diameter two and one-half
inches in length. The capacity of this funnel is 500 cc. It shall be
provided at the bottom with a tightly fitting rubber stopper with a
single perforation and a disk of silk bolting cloth over the hole about
three eighths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. A counting cell consisting of a brass rim closely cemented to a
plate of optical glass. The shape and size of this cell are not essential
but its depth shall be one millimeter. A convenient capacity is
about one cubic centimeter.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. An ocular micrometer ruled as follows: The ocular micrometer
is commonly of such a size that with a 16 mm. objective and a suitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>tube length, the largest square cuts off one square millimeter
on the stage.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Procedure.</em>—Filter 250 cc. of the water (more or less according to
the clearness of the sample) through a one-half inch layer of quartz
sand (washed and screened between 60 and 120 mesh sieves)
supported by the disk of bolting cloth and rubber stopper at the
bottom of the funnel. Suction may be applied to hasten the filtration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remove the stopper and catch the plug of sand and its entrained
organisms in a small beaker or test tube, washing down the inside
of the funnel into the beaker with 5 cc. of clean (preferably distilled)
water. Agitate the mixture of sand, water, and organisms to
detach the latter from the sand grains, and quickly decant the water
and the organisms in suspension to a test tube. If desired the sand
may then be again washed with 5 cc. water and the wash water added
to the first portion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cover the cell partially with a cover glass, and by means of a
pipette run the concentrate under the cover glass until the cell is
completely filled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cover and place on the microscope stage in a horizontal position
for examination.</p>

<p class='c009'>Count the organisms in twenty fields, i. e., twenty cubic millimeters,
estimating their areas in terms of Standard Units.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>The Standard Unit is the smallest square in the ocular micrometer,
and represents an area 20µ × 20µ, or 400 square microns on the stage.</em></p>

<p class='c009'>Results shall be expressed in the number of Standard Units of
each kind of micro-organism per cc. and also the total number of
standard units of all kinds per cc. The general directions as to
significant figures given under Turbidity shall apply also to the
microscopical examination.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Caution.</em>—Many micro-organisms, especially some of those
causing odors, are so fragile that they are broken up in filtration,
especially if the agitation of the filtrate is too vigorous. A direct
examination of a fresh sample is therefore a useful supplementary
procedure. For the same reason the concentrate should not stand
long before examination. Also some organisms are carried by
specific gravity to the top of the cell which should be scrutinized as
well as the bottom layer each time.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is always better to examine the micro-organisms in the field
when possible, and for this purpose the sling filter has been devised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>consisting of a metal funnel slung to a pivoted handle, with a disk
of wire gauze in the detachable lower end to support the sand.
Filtration is hastened by imparting a whirling motion to the whole
and utilizing the centrifugal force thus generated.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>I. APPARATUS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>1. <em>Sample Bottles.</em>—Any size, shape or quality of bottle may be
used for a bacterial sample, provided it holds a sufficient amount
to carry out all the tests required and is such that it may be properly
washed and sterilized and will keep the sample uncontaminated
until the analysis is made. Four- or eight-ounce, ground-glass-stoppered
bottles are recommended. These should be protected
by being wrapped in paper, or their necks covered with tin foil,
and should be placed in proper boxes for transportation.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <em>Pipettes.</em>—Pipettes may be of any convenient size or shape
provided it is found by actual test that they deliver accurately the
required amount in the manner in which they are used. The error
of calibration shall in no case exceed 2 per cent. Protecting the
pipettes with a cotton stopper is recommended.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. <em>Dilution Bottles.</em>—Bottles for use in making dilutions should
preferably be of tall form, of such capacity as to hold at least twice
the volume of water actually used. Close-fitting ground-glass stoppers
are preferable, but tight fitting cotton stoppers may be used,
provided due care is taken to prevent contamination and to avoid
loss of volume through wetting of the stopper before mixing has
been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. <em>Petri Dishes.</em>—Petri dishes ten centimeters in diameter shall
be used with glass or porous tops<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c015'><sup>[211]</sup></a> as preferred. The bottoms of the
dishes shall be as flat as possible so that the medium shall be of
uniform thickness throughout the plate.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. <em>Fermentation Tubes.</em>—Any type of fermentation tube<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c015'><sup>[203]</sup></a> may be
used provided it holds at least three times as much medium as the
amount of water to be tested.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>1. <em>Water.</em>—Distilled water shall be used in the preparation of
all culture media and reagents.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. <em>Meat Extract.</em>—Liebig’s meat extract shall be used in place of
meat infusion. Other brands may be substituted for Liebig’s when
comparative tests have shown that they give equivalent results.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. <em>Peptone.</em>—Armour’s, Digestive Ferments Company’s, Fairchild’s,
or any other peptone which gives equivalent results may be
used.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. <em>Sugars.</em>—All sugars used shall be of the highest purity obtainable.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. <em>Agar.</em>—The agar used shall be of the best quality and shall be
dried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing. Much of the
agar on the market contains considerable amounts of sea salts.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c015'><sup>[221]</sup></a><a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c015'><sup>[225]</sup></a><a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c015'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
These may be removed by soaking in water and draining before use.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. <em>Gelatin.</em>—The gelatin used shall be of light color, shall contain
not more than a trace of arsenic, copper, sulfides, and shall be free
from preservatives, and of such a melting point that a 10 per cent.
standard nutrient gelatin shall have a melting point of 25° C. or over.
Gelatin shall be dried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. <em>Litmus.</em>—Reagent litmus of highest purity (not litmus cubes)
or azolitmin (Kahlbaum) shall be used for all media requiring a litmus
indicator.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>1. PREPARATION OF CULTURE MEDIA.</h4>

<h5 class='c016'>a. <em>Adjustment of Reaction.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'><em>aa.</em> <em>Phenol Red Method for adjustment to a hydrogen-ion concentration
of P<sub>H+</sub> = 6.8–8.4.</em> Withdraw 5 cc. of the medium, dilute with
5 cc. of distilled water, and add 5 drops of a solution of phenol red
(phenol sulphone phthalein). This solution is made by dissolving
0.04 grams of phenol red in 30 cc. of alcohol and diluting to 100 cc.
with distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Titrate with a 1:10 dilution of a standard solution of NaOH
(which need not be of known normality) until the phenol red shows
a slight but distinct pink color. Calculate the amount of the standard
NaOH solution which must be added to the medium to reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>this reaction. After the addition check the reaction by adding 5
drops of phenol red to 5 cc. of the medium and 5 cc. of water.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>bb.</em> <em>Titration with phenolphthalein.</em> (For the convenience of those
who wish to retain the use of this method for the present it is given
here, but it is recommended that as soon as possible the more accurate
method of determining the hydrogen-ion concentration be substituted.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In a white porcelain dish put 5 cc. of the medium to be tested,
add 45 cc. of distilled water. Boil briskly for one minute. Add
1 cc. of phenolphthalein solution (5 grams of commercial salt to one
liter of 50 per cent. alcohol). Titrate immediately with a n/20
solution of sodium hydrate. A faint but distinct pink color marks
the true end-point. This color may be precisely described as a
combination of 25 per cent. of red (wave length approximately 658)
with 75 per cent. of white as shown by the disks of the standard color
top made by the Milton Bradley Educational Co., Springfield, Mass.</p>

<p class='c009'>All reactions shall be expressed with reference to the phenolphthalein
neutral point and shall be stated in percentages of normal acid
or alkali solutions required to neutralize them. Alkaline media
shall be recorded with a minus (-) sign before the percentage of
normal acid needed for their neutralization and acid media with a
plus (+) sign before the percentage of normal alkali solution needed
for their neutralization.</p>

<p class='c009'>The standard reaction for culture media for water analysis shall
be +1.0 per cent., as determined by tests of the sterilized medium.
As ordinarily prepared, broth and agar will be found to have a
reaction between +0.5 and +1.0. For such media no adjustment
shall be made. The reaction of media containing sugar shall be
neutral to phenolphthalein. Whenever reactions other than the
standard are used, it shall be so stated.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>b. <em>Sterilization.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>All media and dilution water shall be sterilized in the autoclav
at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after the pressure reaches 15 lbs.
All air must be forced out of the autoclav before the pressure
is allowed to rise. As soon as possible after sterilization the media
shall be removed from the autoclav and cooled rapidly. Rapid
and immediate cooling of gelatin is imperative.</p>

<p class='c009'>Media shall be sterilized in small containers, and these must not
be closely packed together. No part of the medium shall be more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>than 2.5 cm. from the outside surface of the glass. All glassware
shall be sterilized in the dry oven at 170° C. for at least 1½ hours.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>c. <em>Nutrient Broth. To Make One Liter.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>1. Add 3 grams of beef extract and 5 grams of peptone to 1,000 cc.
of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Heat slowly on a steam bath to at least 65° C.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Make up lost weight and adjust the reaction to a faint pink
with phenol red, or if the phenolphthalein titration is used, and the
reaction is not already between +0.5 and +1, adjust to +1.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Cool to 25° C. and filter through filter paper until clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Distribute in test-tubes, 10 cc. to each tube.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes
after the pressure reaches 15 lbs.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>d. <em>Sugar Broths.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>Sugar broths shall be prepared in the same general manner as nutrient
broth with the addition of 0.5 per cent. of the required carbohydrate
just before sterilization. The removal of muscle sugar is
unnecessary as the beef extract and peptone are free from any fermentable
carbohydrates. The reaction of sugar broths shall be a
faint pink with phenol red or, if on titration with phenolphthalein
the reaction is not already between neutral and +1, adjust to neutral.
Sterilization shall be in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for
15 minutes after the pressure reaches 15 lbs., provided the total
time of exposure to heat is not more than one-half hour; otherwise
a 10 per cent. solution of the required carbohydrate shall be made in
distilled water and sterilized at 100° C. for 1½ hours, and this solution
shall be added to sterile nutrient broth in amounts sufficient
to make a 0.5 per cent. solution of the carbohydrate and the mixture
shall then be tubed and sterilized at 100° C. for 30 minutes, or it is
permissible to add by means of a sterile pipette directly to a tube of
sterile neutral broth enough of the carbohydrate to make the required
0.5 per cent. The tubes so made shall be incubated at 37° C.
for 24 hours as a test for sterility.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>e. <em>Nutrient Gelatin. To Make One Liter.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>1. Add 3 grams of beef extract and 5 grams of peptone to 1,000 cc.
of distilled water and add 100 grams of gelatin dried for one-half
hour at 105° C. before weighing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>2. Heat slowly on a steam bath to 65° C. until all gelatin is dissolved.<a id='rG' /><a href='#fG' class='c015'><sup>[G]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='fG'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#rG'>G</a>. The solution of the gelatin will be facilitated by allowing it to soak in the cold one-half hour
before heating.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>3. Make up lost weight and adjust the reaction to a faint pink
with phenol red, or if the phenolphthalein titration is used, and the
reaction is not already between +0.5 and +1, adjust to +1.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Filter through cloth and cotton until clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Distribute in test-tubes, 10 cc. to each tube, or in larger containers
as desired.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes
after the pressure reaches 15 lbs.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>f. <em>Nutrient Agar. To Make One Liter.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>1. Add 3 grams of beef extract, 5 grams of peptone and 12
grams of agar, dried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing,
to 1,000 cc. of distilled water. Boil over a water bath until all
agar is dissolved, and then make up the loss by evaporation.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Cool to 45° C. in a cold water bath, then warm to 65° C. in the
same bath, without stirring.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Make up lost weight and adjust the reaction to a faint pink
with phenol red, or if the phenolphthalein titration is used, and the
reaction is not already between +0.5 and +1, adjust to +1.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Filter through cloth and cotton until clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Distribute in test-tubes, 10 cc. to each tube, or in larger containers,
as desired.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes
after the pressure reaches 15 lbs.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>g. <em>Litmus or Azolitmin Solution.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>The standard litmus solution shall be a 2 per cent. aqueous
solution of reagent litmus. Powder the litmus, add to the water
and boil for five minutes. The solution usually needs no correction
in reaction and may be at once distributed in flasks or test-tubes
and sterilized as is culture media. It should give a distinctly blue
plate when 1 cc. is added to 10 cc. of neutral culture medium in
a Petri dish.</p>

<p class='c009'>The standard azolitmin solution shall be a 1 per cent. solution of
Kahlbaum’s azolitmin. Add the azolitmin powder to the water
and boil for five minutes. The solution may need to be corrected
in reaction by the addition of sodium hydrate solution so that it
will be approximately neutral and will give a distinctly blue plate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>when 1 cc. is added to 10 cc. of neutral culture medium in a Petri
dish. It may be distributed in flasks or test-tubes and sterilized
as is culture media.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>h. <em>Litmus-lactose-agar.</em></h5>

<p class='c011'>Litmus-lactose-agar shall be prepared in the same manner as
nutrient agar with the addition of 1 per cent. of lactose just before
sterilization. The reaction shall be a faint pink with phenol red, or,
if on titration with phenolphthalein the reaction is not already
between neutral and +1, adjust to neutral. One cc. of sterilized
litmus or azolitmin solution shall be added to each 10 cc. of the
medium just before it is poured into the Petri dish, or the mixture
may be made in the dish itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. Add 5 grams of beef extract, 10 grams of peptone and 30
grams of agar dried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing,
to 1,000 cc. of distilled water. Boil on a water bath until all the agar
is dissolved and then make up the loss by evaporation.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Cool the mixture to 45° C. in a cold water bath, then warm to
65° C. in the same bath without stirring.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. Make up lost weight, titrate, and if the reaction is not already
between neutral and +1 adjust to neutral.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Filter through cloth and cotton until clear.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. Distribute 100 cc. or larger known quantities in flasks large
enough to hold the other ingredients which are to be added later.</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after
the pressure reaches 15 lbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>7. Prepare a 10 per cent. solution of basic fuchsin in 95 per cent.
alcohol, allow to stand 20 hours, decant and filter the supernatant
fluid. This is a stock solution.</p>

<p class='c009'>8. When ready to make plates melt 100 cc. of agar in streaming
steam or on a water bath. Dissolve 1 gram of lactose in 15 cc. of
distilled water, using heat if necessary. Dissolve 0.25 gram anhydrous
sodium sulphite in 10 cc. water. To the sulphite solution add
0.5 cc. of the fuchsin stock solution. Add the fuchsin-sulphite solution
to the lactose solution and then add the resulting solution to
the melted agar. The lactose used must be chemically pure and the
sulphite solution must be made up fresh.</p>

<p class='c009'>9. Pour plates and allow to harden thoroughly in the incubator
before use.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>2. COLLECTION OF SAMPLE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Samples for bacterial analysis shall be collected in bottles which
have been cleansed with great care, rinsed in clean water, and sterilized
with dry heat for at least one hour and a half at 170° C., or
in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes or longer after the
pressure reaches 15 lbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Great care must be exercised to have the samples representative
of the water to be tested and to see that no contamination occurs
at the time of filling the sample bottles.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>3. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF SAMPLES.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Because of the rapid and often extensive changes which may take
place in the bacterial flora of bottled samples when stored even at
temperatures as low as 10° C., it is urged, as of importance, that all
samples be examined as promptly as possible after collection.</p>

<p class='c009'>The time allowed for storage or transportation of a bacterial
sample between the filling of the sample bottle and the beginning
of the analysis should be not more than six hours for impure
waters and not more than twelve hours for relatively pure waters.
During the period of storage, the temperature shall be kept as
near 10° C. as possible. Any deviation from the above limits
shall be so stated in making reports.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>4. DILUTIONS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>Dilution bottles shall be filled with the proper amount of tap
water so that after sterilization they shall contain exactly 9 cc. or
99 cc. as desired. The exact amount of water can only be determined
by experiment with the particular autoclav in use. If desired,
the 9 cc. dilution may be measured out from a flask of sterile
water with a sterile pipette.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dilution bottles shall be sterilized in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120°
C.) for 15 minutes after the pressure reaches 15 lbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sample bottle shall be shaken vigorously 25 times and 1 cc.
withdrawn and added to the proper dilution bottles as required.
Each dilution bottle after the addition of the 1 cc. of the sample,
shall be shaken vigorously 25 times before a second dilution is made
from it or before a sample is removed for plating.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>5. PLATING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'>All sample and dilution bottles shall be shaken vigorously 25
times before samples are removed for plating. Plating shall be done
immediately after the dilutions are made. One cc. of the sample
or dilution shall be used for plating and shall be placed in the Petri
dish, first. Ten cc. of liquefied medium at a temperature of 40° C.
shall be added to the 1 cc. of water in the Petri dish. The cover of
the Petri dish shall be lifted just enough for the introduction of the
pipette or culture medium, and the lips of all test-tubes or flasks
used for pouring the medium shall be flamed. In making litmus-lactose-agar
plates, 1 cc. of sterile litmus or azolitmin solution shall
be added to each 10 cc. of culture medium either in the Petri dish or
before pouring into the Petri dish. The medium and sample in the
Petri dish shall be thoroughly mixed and uniformly spread over the
bottom of the Petri dish by tilting or rotating the dish. All plates
shall be solidified as rapidly as possible after pouring and gelatin
plates shall be placed immediately in the 20° C. incubator and the
agar plates in the 37° C. incubator. Endo plates shall be made by
placing one loopful of the material to be tested on the surface of the
plate and distributing the material with a sterile loop or glass rod.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>6. INCUBATION.</h4>

<p class='c011'>All gelatin plates shall be incubated for 48 hours at 20 C. in a
dark, well-ventilated incubator in an atmosphere practically saturated
with moisture.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>All agar plates shall be incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. in a dark,
well-ventilated incubator in an atmosphere practically saturated
with moisture. Glass covered plates shall be inverted in the incubator.
Any deviation from the above described method shall be
stated in making reports.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>7. COUNTING.</h4>

<p class='c011'>In preparing plates, such amounts of the water under examination
shall be planted as will give from 25 to 250 colonies on a plate;<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c015'><sup>[202]</sup></a><a id='r201'></a> and
the aim should be always to have at least two plates giving colonies
between these limits. Where it is possible to obtain plates showing
colonies within these limits, only such plates should be considered
in recording results, except where the same amount of water has
been planted in two or more plates, of which one gives colonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>within these limits, while the others give less than 25 or more than
250. In such case, the result recorded should be the average of all
the plates planted with this amount of water. Ordinarily it is not
desirable to plant more than 1 cc. of water in a plate; therefore, when
the total number of colonies developing from 1 cc. is less than 25,
it is obviously necessary to record the results as observed, disregarding
the general rule given above.</p>

<p class='c009'>Counting shall in all cases be done with a lens of 2½ diameter’s
magnification, 3½X. The Engraver’s Lens No. 146 made by the
Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company fills the requirements, and is a
convenient lens for the purpose.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>8. THE TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE B. COLI GROUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>It is recommended that the B. coli group be considered as including
all non-spore-forming bacilli which ferment lactose with gas
formation and grow aërobically on standard solid media.</p>

<p class='c009'>The formation of 10 per cent. or more of gas in a standard lactose
broth fermentation tube within 24 hours at 37° C. is presumptive
evidence of the presence of members of the B. coli group, since the
majority of the bacteria which give such a reaction belong to this
group.</p>

<p class='c009'>The appearance of aërobic lactose-splitting colonies on lactose-litmus-agar
or Endo’s medium plates made from a lactose broth
fermentation tube in which gas has formed confirms to a considerable
extent the presumption that gas-formation in the fermentation
tube was due to the presence of members of the B. coli group.</p>

<p class='c009'>To complete the demonstration of the presence of B. coli
as above defined, it is necessary to show that one or more of these
aërobic plate colonies consists of non-spore-forming bacilli which,
when inoculated into a lactose broth fermentation tube, form gas.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is recommended that the standard tests for the B. coli group
be either (A) the <em>Presumptive</em>, (B) the <em>Partially Confirmed</em>, or (C)
the <em>Completed</em> test as hereafter defined, each test being applicable
under the circumstances specified.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>A. PRESUMPTIVE TEST.</h5>

<p class='c011'>1. Inoculate a series of fermentation tubes with appropriate
graduated quantities of the water to be tested. In every fermentation
tube there must always be at least three times as much medium
as the amount of water to be tested. When necessary to examine
larger amounts than 10 cc. as many tubes as necessary shall be
inoculated with 10 cc. each.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Incubate these tubes at 37° C. for 48 hours. Examine each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>tube at 24 and 48 hours, and record gas-formation. The records
should be such as to distinguish between:</p>

<p class='c009'>(a) Absence of gas-formation.</p>

<p class='c009'>(b) Formation of gas occupying less than ten per cent. (10%)
of the closed arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>(c) Formation of gas occupying more than ten per cent. (10%)
of the closed arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>More detailed records of the amount of gas formed, though
desirable for purposes of study, are not necessary for carrying out
the standard tests prescribed.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The formation within 24 hours of gas occupying more than
ten per cent. (10%) of the closed arm of fermentation tube constitutes
<em>a positive presumptive test</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. If no gas is formed in 24 hours, or if the gas formed is less than
ten per cent. (10%), the incubation shall be continued to 48 hours.
The presence of gas in any amount in such a tube at 48 hours constitutes
<em>a doubtful test</em>, which in all cases requires confirmation.</p>

<p class='c009'>5. The absence of gas formation after 48 hours’ incubation constitutes
<em>a negative test</em>. (An arbitrary limit of 48 hours’ observation
doubtless excludes from consideration occasional members of the B.
coli group which form gas very slowly, but for the purposes of a
standard test the exclusion of these occasional slow gas-forming
organisms is considered immaterial.)</p>

<h5 class='c016'>B. PARTIALLY CONFIRMED TEST.</h5>

<p class='c011'>1. Make one or more Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar
plates from the tube which, after 48 hours’ incubation, shows gas
formation from the smallest amount of water tested. (For example,
if the water has been tested in amounts of 10 cc., 1 cc., and 0.1 cc.,
and gas is formed in 10 cc., and 1 cc., not in 0.1 cc., the test need be
confirmed only in the 1 cc. amount.)</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Incubate the plates at 37° C., 18 to 24 hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. If typical colon-like red colonies have developed upon the plate
within this period, the confirmed test may be considered positive.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. If, however, no typical colonies have developed within 24
hours, the test cannot yet be considered definitely negative, since
it not infrequently happens that members of the B. coli group fail
to form typical colonies on Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar
plates, or that the colonies develop slowly. In such case, it is always
necessary to complete the test as directed under “C” 2 and 3.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h5 class='c016'>C. COMPLETED TEST.</h5>
</div>

<p class='c011'>1. From the Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plate made
as prescribed under “B,” fish at least two typical colonies, transferring
each to an agar slant and a lactose broth fermentation tube.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. If no typical colonies appear upon the plate within 24 hours,
the plate should be reincubated another 24 hours, after which at
least two of the colonies considered to be most likely B. coli, whether
typical or not, shall be transferred to agar slants and lactose broth
fermentation tubes.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The lactose broth fermentation tubes thus inoculated shall
be incubated until gas formation is noted; the incubation not to
exceed 48 hours. The agar slants shall be incubated at 37° C. for
48 hours, when a microscopic examination shall be made of at least
one culture, selecting one which corresponds to one of the lactose
broth fermentation tubes which has shown gas-formation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The formation of gas in lactose broth and the demonstration of
non-spore-forming bacilli in the agar culture shall be considered a
satisfactory completed test, demonstrating the presence of a member
of the B. coli group.</p>

<p class='c009'>The absence of gas-formation in lactose broth or failure to
demonstrate non-spore-forming bacilli in a gas-forming culture constitutes
a negative test.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>APPLICATION OF PRESUMPTIVE, PARTIALLY CONFIRMED, AND COMPLETED TESTS.</h5>

<h6 class='c016'>A. The Presumptive Test.</h6>

<p class='c028'>1. When definitely positive, that is showing more than 10 per
cent. (10%) of gas in 24 hours, is sufficient:</p>

<p class='c029'>(a) As applied to all except the smallest gas-forming portion
of each sample in all examinations.</p>

<p class='c029'>(b) As applied to the smallest gas-forming portion in the
examination of sewage or of water showing relatively
high pollution, such that its fitness for use as drinking
water does not come into consideration. This applies
to the routine examinations of raw water in connection
with control of the operation of purification plants.</p>

<p class='c030'>2. When definitely negative, that is showing no gas in 48 hours,
is final and therefore sufficient in all cases.</p>

<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>3. When doubtful, that is showing gas less than 10 per cent.
(10%) (or none) in 24 hours, with gas either more or less
than 10 per cent. in 48 hours, must always be confirmed.</p>

<h6 class='c016'>B. The Partially Confirmed Test.</h6>

<p class='c028'>1. When definitely positive, that is, showing typical plate
colonies within 24 hours, is sufficient:</p>

<p class='c029'>(a) When applied to confirm a doubtful presumptive test
in cases where the latter, if definitely positive, would
have been sufficient.</p>

<p class='c029'>(b) In the routine examination of water supplies where a
sufficient number of prior examinations have established
a satisfactory index of the accuracy and significance of
this test in terms of the completed test.</p>

<p class='c030'>2. When doubtful, that is, showing colonies of doubtful or
negative appearance in 24 hours, must always be completed.</p>

<h6 class='c016'>C. The Completed Test.</h6>

<p class='c028'>The completed test is required as applied to the smallest gas-forming
portion of each sample in all cases other than those
noted as exceptions under the “presumptive” and the “partially
confirmed” tests.</p>

<p class='c030'>The completed test is required in <em>all</em> cases where the result of
the confirmed test has been doubtful.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>In order that tests for B. coli may have quantitative significance,
the following general principles and rules should be observed:</p>

<p class='c009'>Ordinarily not less than three portions of each sample should be
tested, the portions being even decimal multiples or fractions of a
cubic centimeter; for example, 10 cc., 1 cc., 0.1 cc., .01 cc., etc.
It is essential that the dilutions should be such that the largest
amount gives a positive test (unless the water is such as to give
negative tests in 10 cc.), and the smallest dilution, a negative result.
To insure this result, it is often necessary to plant four or five dilutions,
especially in the examination of a sample of entirely unknown
quality. The quantitative value of a series of tests is lost, unless all
or at least a large proportion of the smallest dilutions tested have
given negative results.</p>

<p class='c009'>In reporting a single test, it is preferable merely to record results
as observed, indicating the amounts tested and the result in each,
rather than to attempt expression of the result in numbers of B.
coli per cc. In summarizing the results of a series of tests, however,
it is desirable, for the sake of simplicity, to express the results in
terms of the numbers of B. coli per cc., or per 100 cc. To convert
results of fermentation tests to this form, the result of each test is
recorded as indicating a number of B. coli per cc. equal to the
reciprocal of the smallest decimal or multiple fraction of a cubic
centimeter giving a positive result. For example, the result:
10 cc. +; 1 cc. +; 0.1 cc. -; would be recorded as indicating one B.
coli per cc. An exception should be made in the case where a negative
result is obtained in an amount larger than the smallest portion
giving a positive result; for example, in a result such as: 10 cc.
+; 1 cc. -; 0.1 cc. +. In such case, the result should be recorded
as indicating a number of B. coli per cc. equal to the reciprocal of
the dilution next larger than the smallest one giving a positive test,
this being a more probable result.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where tests are made in amounts larger than 1 cc., giving average
results less than one B. coli per cc., it is more convenient to express
results in terms of the numbers of B. coli per 100 cc.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following table illustrates the method of recording and averaging
results of B. coli tests:</p>

<p class='c009'>The above method of expressing results is not mathematically
altogether correct. The average number of B. coli per cc., as thus
estimated, is not precisely the most probable number calculated by
application of the theory of probability.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c015'><sup>[220]</sup></a> To apply this theory to a
correct mathematical solution of any considerable series of results
involves, however, mathematical calculations so complex as to be
impracticable of application in general practice. The simpler
method given is therefore considered preferable, since it is easily
applied and the results so expressed are readily comprehensible.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order that results as reported may be checked and carefully
valuated, it is necessary that the report should show not only the
average number of B. coli per cc., but also the number of samples
examined; and, for each dilution, the total number of tests made, and
the number (or per cent.) positive.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.</h4>

<p class='c011'>While it is not within the province of this report to suggest the
proper interpretation of results obtained by the use of the methods
herein specified as standard, the committee feels that a word of
caution should be given regarding the significance of the presence
in a water of members of the B. coli group as defined in this report.
Recent work seems to indicate that the B. coli group as herein
defined consists of organisms of both fecal and non-fecal origin.
Therefore care must be exercised in judging the sanitary quality
of a water solely from the determination of the presence of members
of the group.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>11. DIFFERENTIATION OF FECAL FROM NON-FECAL MEMBERS OF THE B. COLI GROUP.</h4>

<p class='c011'>(1) At least 10 cultures should be used. If possible these should
be subcultured from plates made direct from the water since all of
the cultures obtained by plating from fermentation tubes may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>descendants of a single cell in the water. If cultures from water
plates are not available those obtained from plates made as prescribed
under B (p. <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>) may be used.</p>

<p class='c009'>(2) Inoculate each culture into dextrose potassium phosphate
broth,<a id='rH' /><a href='#fH' class='c015'><sup>[H]</sup></a> adonite broth, and gelatin. For additional confirmatory
evidence inoculation may be made into tryptophane broth,<a id='rI' /><a href='#fI' class='c015'><sup>[I]</sup></a> and
saccharose broth. The dextrose broth must be incubated at 30°.
Other sugar broths may be incubated at 30° or 37° as convenient.
Gelatin should be incubated at 20°.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. To 800 cc. of distilled water add 5 grams of Proteose-Peptone, Difco., or Witte’s Peptone (other
peptones should not be substituted), 5 grams c. p. dextrose, and 5 grams dipotassium hydrogen
phosphate (K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>). A dilute solution of the K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> should give a distinct pink with phenolphthalein.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. Heat with occasional stirring over steam for twenty minutes.</p>

cc.), and sterilize in autoclave for 15 minutes after the pressure reaches 15 pounds. Some American
peptones are standardized to contain a uniform amount of tryptophane. If such peptone is used
the tryptophane in the above formula may be omitted and the peptone increased to 5 grams.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(3) After 48 hours record gas formation in adonite and saccharose
broths. Determine indol formation in tryptophane broth by
adding drop by drop, to avoid mixing with the medium, about 1
cc. of a 2 per cent. alcoholic solution of p-dimethyl amido-benzaldehyd,
then a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The
presence of indol is indicated by a red color which is soluble in chloroform.
There may be some unconverted tryptophane still present
which will give a distinctly blue color which is insoluble in chloroform.
A mixture of the two will be either blue or violet. If from
such a mixture of colors the red of indol be extracted with chloroform
proof of the presence of indol will be complete.</p>

concentration of the medium is fixed by the composition. It should be very close to P<sub>H</sub> 7.0,
slightly red with phenol red. All materials should be recrystallized or if used from stock furnished
by manufacturers, should be carefully examined. The di-sodium hydrogen phosphate may be used
either as the anhydrous salt obtained by dessication in vacuo at 100° C. or else as the salt containing
two molecules of water of crystallization. This is obtained by exposing the recrystallized Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.12H<sub>2</sub>O

<p class='c040'><em>First Day</em>:</p>

<p class='c041'>1. Prepare dilutions as required.</p>

<p class='c041'>2. Make two (2) gelatin plates from each dilution, and incubate

<p class='c041'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>4. Inoculate lactose broth fermentation tubes with appropriate
amounts for B. coli tests, inoculating two (2) tubes
with each amount.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note:—Where repeated tests are made of water from the same
source, as is customary in the control of public supplies, it is not
necessary to make duplicate plates or fermentation tubes in each
dilution. It is sufficient, in such circumstances, to make duplicate
plates only from the dilution which will most probably give from
25 to 250 colonies per plate.</p>

<p class='c042'><em>Second Day</em>:</p>

<p class='c041'>1. Count the agar plates made on the first day.</p>

<p class='c041'>2. Record the number of lactose broth fermentation tubes
which show 10 per cent. (10%) or more of gas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note:—In case only the presumptive test for B. coli is required,
fermentation tubes showing more than 10 per cent. (10%) of gas at
this time may be discarded.</p>

<p class='c042'><em>Third Day</em>:</p>

<p class='c041'>1. Count gelatin plates made on first day.</p>

<p class='c041'>2. Record the number of additional fermentation tubes which
show 10 per cent. (10%) or more of gas.</p>

<p class='c041'>3. Make a lactose-litmus-agar or Endo’s medium plate from
the smallest portion of each sample showing gas. Incubate
plate at 37° C.</p>

<p class='c009'>Note:—In case the smallest portion in which gas has been formed
shows less than 10 per cent. (10%) of gas, it is well to make a plate
also from the next larger portion, so that, in case the smallest portion
gives a negative end result it may still be possible to demonstrate
B. coli in the next larger dilution.</p>

<p class='c042'><em>Fourth Day</em>:</p>

<p class='c041'>1. Examine Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plates. If
typical colonies have developed, select two and transfer
each to a lactose broth fermentation tube and an agar slant,
both of which are to be incubated at 37° C.</p>

<p class='c041'>2. If no typical B. coli colonies are found, incubate the plates
another 24 hours.</p>

<p class='c042'><em>Fifth Day</em>:</p>

<p class='c041'>1. Select at least two colonies, whether typical or not, from the
Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plates which have been

the test as for typical colonies.</p>

<p class='c041'>2. Examine lactose broth fermentation tubes inoculated from
plates on the previous day. Tubes in which gas has been
formed may be discarded after the result has been recorded.
Those in which no gas has formed should be incubated an
additional 24 hours.</p>

<p class='c042'><em>Sixth Day</em>:</p>

<p class='c041'>1. Examine lactose broth fermentation tubes reincubated the
